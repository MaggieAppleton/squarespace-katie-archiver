Who selects them?  Who pays for them?  Who manages them (in terms of checking books out and in)?  Who inventories them?  Who refreshes them?  How are they organized (virtually and physically)?  How much consistency across classrooms is there?</em></p><p>At some schools, a grade or department is given money to buy books for the classroom -- and those books are labeled in some way as school property and listed in some spreadsheet for inventory purposes.  At other schools, classroom libraries are pretty much private collections, consisting of books a teacher brings with them or inherits from the previous tenant of the room.  The first situation makes it hard to know the full picture of resources across grades and departments, and the second raises equity issues. </p><p>At our campus all resources -- whether library books, textbooks, or classroom library books -- no matter what budget has paid for them -- are barcoded, cataloged, and given a location code in our library system (Destiny).  So anyone can search and see what resources are being used where.</p><h3><strong>creating Core/CLASS Libraries</strong></h3><p>At first our MS English curriculum used the <strong>whole-class novel assignment model</strong>, so the priority was selecting and buying a set number of titles in large quantities, and the issue of setting up class libraries was postponed (with teachers using the main library as their classroom in the meantime). Then two years ago we began the switch to the <a href=\"http://readingandwritingproject.org/about\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Reading Workshop model</strong></a>, where independent reading and self-choice from a wide range of books are key.  It was time to tackle the issue of class libraries.</p><p>There was a pool of money.  And we already had some multiple copies of books (from the old model).  So each teacher began to make lists of books they wanted in their classrooms.</p><p>But what made it interesting was that the teachers had come together from a variety of cultural backgrounds -- Australia, the UK, the US, the Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland -- and our school, though Anglo-heritage, is not tied to any one national curriculum.  So the authors and titles on one person's list of favorites for teaching middle school were potentially unfamiliar to another.</p><p>The solution was to develop a <strong>Core Library</strong> for each grade, consisting of 30 titles -- to be agreed by the group of teachers. (NB: The use of the word \"core\" does not mean any connection to the US \"Common Core\" curriculum initiative.)</p><p>These Core Libraries -- for <a href=\"http://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg/cataloging/servlet/handlebasicsearchform.do?keywordText=g6cl+corelib&amp;siteTypeID=-2&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;siteID=&amp;includeLibrary=true&amp;includeMedia=false&amp;mediaSiteID=&amp;doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&amp;awardGroupID=-1&amp;site=103\" target=\"_blank\">Grade 6</a>, <a href=\"http://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg/cataloging/servlet/handlebasicsearchform.do?keywordText=g7cl+corelib&amp;siteTypeID=-2&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;siteID=&amp;includeLibrary=true&amp;includeMedia=false&amp;mediaSiteID=&amp;doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&amp;awardGroupID=-1&amp;site=103\">Grade 7</a>, and <a href=\"http://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg/cataloging/servlet/handlebasicsearchform.do?keywordText=g8cl+corelib&amp;siteTypeID=-2&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;siteID=&amp;includeLibrary=true&amp;includeMedia=false&amp;mediaSiteID=&amp;doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&amp;awardGroupID=-1&amp;site=103\" target=\"_blank\">Grade 8</a> -- would be a negotiated list of the \"best books\" for that grade, i.e., the books kids shouldn't miss, the books to booktalk first, the characters and stories you want as a common reference point, and mentor texts.  (A manageable list of recommended books also helps with the anxiety related to the <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">paradox of choice</a>, especially for reluctant readers.)</p><p>Each classroom -- and the library -- would have multiple copies available of these Core Library titles.  And English teachers would commit to reading their way through the 90 titles, in order to create a shared literary experience.</p><p>The selection process involved several sessions in the library where the list was physically constructed by filling in a bookcase in the Middle School Zone that conveniently holds three 5x6 arrays of (90) books in a face-out display. </p><p>Teachers drafted their core libraries by literally placing books on the bookcase, until all 90 slots were filled with what everyone agreed was a good balance of texts -- within a grade and across the middle school (while also taking into consideration key texts used in grade 5 and grades 9, 10, etc..)</p>\n</div>\n</div></div><div

Who selects them?  Who pays for them?  Who manages them (in terms of checking books out and in)?  Who inventories them?  Who refreshes them?  How are they organized (virtually and physically)?  How much consistency across classrooms is there?At some schools, a grade or department is given money to buy books for the classroom -- and those books are labeled in some way as school property and listed in some spreadsheet for inventory purposes.  At other schools, classroom libraries are pretty much private collections, consisting of books a teacher brings with them or inherits from the previous tenant of the room.  The first situation makes it hard to know the full picture of resources across grades and departments, and the second raises equity issues. At our campus all resources -- whether library books, textbooks, or classroom library books -- no matter what budget has paid for them -- are barcoded, cataloged, and given a location code in our library system (Destiny).  So anyone can search and see what resources are being used where.### creating Core/CLASS LibrariesAt first our MS English curriculum used the whole-class novel assignment model, so the priority was selecting and buying a set number of titles in large quantities, and the issue of setting up class libraries was postponed (with teachers using the main library as their classroom in the meantime). Then two years ago we began the switch to the Reading Workshop model, where independent reading and self-choice from a wide range of books are key.  It was time to tackle the issue of class libraries.There was a pool of money.  And we already had some multiple copies of books (from the old model).  So each teacher began to make lists of books they wanted in their classrooms.But what made it interesting was that the teachers had come together from a variety of cultural backgrounds -- Australia, the UK, the US, the Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland -- and our school, though Anglo-heritage, is not tied to any one national curriculum.  So the authors and titles on one person's list of favorites for teaching middle school were potentially unfamiliar to another.The solution was to develop a Core Library for each grade, consisting of 30 titles -- to be agreed by the group of teachers. (NB: The use of the word \"core\" does not mean any connection to the US \"Common Core\" curriculum initiative.)These Core Libraries -- for Grade 6, Grade 7, and Grade 8 -- would be a negotiated list of the \"best books\" for that grade, i.e., the books kids shouldn't miss, the books to booktalk first, the characters and stories you want as a common reference point, and mentor texts.  (A manageable list of recommended books also helps with the anxiety related to the paradox of choice, especially for reluctant readers.)Each classroom -- and the library -- would have multiple copies available of these Core Library titles.  And English teachers would commit to reading their way through the 90 titles, in order to create a shared literary experience.The selection process involved several sessions in the library where the list was physically constructed by filling in a bookcase in the Middle School Zone that conveniently holds three 5x6 arrays of (90) books in a face-out display. Teachers drafted their core libraries by literally placing books on the bookcase, until all 90 slots were filled with what everyone agreed was a good balance of texts -- within a grade and across the middle school (while also taking into consideration key texts used in grade 5 and grades 9, 10, etc..)\n\nEvery year the core lists are reviewed.
