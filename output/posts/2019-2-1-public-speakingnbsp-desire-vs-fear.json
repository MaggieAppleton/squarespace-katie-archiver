Or just plain fear?</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate how much my stage fright is related to my commitment to the content of my message and how much time and attention I have given to preparing the form of my presentation.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For example, when I was 32, my father died after a long illness.  As it was an expected death, my siblings and I had plenty of time to ponder his influence and importance in our lives.  When it came to planning the funeral, I was the last person they thought who would want to speak publicly, especially at an emotional event.  But I did want to.  Because I knew exactly what I wanted to say about my father.  I worked hard on my speech, spent time memorising it (so I wouldn’t be afraid of losing my words in the moment), and when the time came, I actually enjoyed sharing my memories of him in front of a crowd.  Which was such a revelation to me.  I wasn’t “cured” of my phobia, just more meta-cognitively aware of all the elements at play when speaking in public.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">You might think, how could a teacher be afraid of public speaking?  They do it every day!  But audience matters.  Peers are more intimidating, especially professional peers who arrive with their own knowledge of the content.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In the teaching and school librarianship world, there are endless opportunities to present to peers, at conferences of various sizes and styles  And I have volunteered many times over the years.  But it’s never an easy decision.  If either my content or my chosen format isn’t solid on the day, I’ll feel that old fear.  Preparation is key.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I keep a list of my public presentations on my website:  see <a href=\"http://www.thelibrarianedge.com/presentations/\">http://www.t</a><a href=\"http://www.thelibrarianedge.com/presentations/\"
