(Why waste your money?)</p><p>A secondary benefit is that you can see your current checkouts, if you opt to login.</p><p>When patrons ask how to get the app, I just point to the poster.</p><h3>features</h3><p><em><strong>Search</strong>:  </em>Includes Library, Digital, and One Search.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Library search results show whether a title is IN or OUT -- and gives one Call Number -- the top one in the list of Available copies. </p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">NB:  What you can't see is the list of all copies and their Sublocations.  A real shame - as we have popular titles in multiple locations.  Another shame is that Subject Headings are not shown for titles.  But perhaps in future versions.</p><p><strong><em>My Lists</em> and <em>Public Lists</em></strong>:  Very useful. Books searched for can be added to \"My List\" from within the app.  NB: Visual Search categories/lists are not accessible via the app.</p><p><strong><em>My Bookshelf</em></strong>:  This accesses the three bookshelves available via the Destiny Quest interface:  <em>Now Reading</em> / <em>Want to Read</em> / <em>Have Read</em>.  It would be great if these lists were part of the traditional interface.</p><p><strong><em>Account</em></strong>:  Very useful.  Users can see titles on hold, titles checked out, fines, and their checkout history.</p><p><strong><em>FollettShelf</em></strong>:  Online access to ebooks, allowing users to read books instantly.  (For offline access, they will need the <em>K-12 Brytewave</em> app shown further on....)</p><p><strong><em>Top 10</em> and <em>New Arrivals</em></strong>:  Unfortunately, these are the Destiny equivalent of click-bait -- catchy titles that fail to deliver real value.  It would be wonderful if we could limit these by other data fields, like Circulation Type.  E.g., <em>New Arrivals</em> only shows the last 15 books cataloged -- and, because our catalog contains ALL texts within the school - whether library books, textbooks, professional books for departments, etc., new arrivals in general aren't of general interest. For the same reason, our <em>Top 10</em> usually reflects unsurprising results, such as textbooks.</p><p>*UPDATED June 13: I just learned that <em>Top 10</em> can be limited by Patron Type circulations, by Material Type, and by Call Number range -- and \"in library use\" can be included, if desired.  So my apologies to Follett!</p><h1>FOLLETT DESTINY</h1>\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-col-6 span-6 float float-right sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_15_1432805043542_11695\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300111154_92\">\n<div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline sqs-narrow-width\" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300111154_91\">\n<figure class=\"sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300111154_90\" style=\"max-width:2500px;\">\n<button class=\"sqs-block-image-button lightbox\" data-description='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2v48k4ynedpjdfg/AAAk4_RCYGyNCaaYQyWZeZ0Ha?dl=0\"&gt;Click here for folder with these posters in Mac Pages, PDF, and PNG format&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' data-lightbox-theme=\"\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300111154_89\">\n<span class=\"v6-visually-hidden\">View fullsize</span>\n<div class=\"image-block-wrapper\" data-animation-override=\"\" data-animation-role=\"image\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300111154_88\">\n<div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300111154_87\" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:141.52000427246094%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \">\n<img alt=\"Click here for folder with these posters in Mac Pages, PDF, and PNG format\" class=\"loaded\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x3538\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-loader=\"sqs\" data-src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png\" data-stretch=\"false\" decoding=\"async\" elementtiming=\"system-image-block\" height=\"3538\" loading=\"lazy\" onload='this.classList.add(\"loaded\")' sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 100vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1432975655512-2OH3N496MZV7NI1RUUGE/image-asset.png?format=2500w 2500w\" style=\"display:block;object-fit: cover;
