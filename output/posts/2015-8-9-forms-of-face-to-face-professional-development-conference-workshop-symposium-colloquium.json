If you know of one, contact me immediately.)</p><p>The online support for any event is also terribly important.  A decent website, available both before and after the event - with all the relevant backup materials - goes without saying, as well as well-publicized hashtags, so people not able to attend can easily eavesdrop.</p><p>As a teacher-librarian, I participate in events designed with teachers in mind (e.g., <a href=\"http://learning2asia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Learning 2.0 Asia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.earcos.org/conf_calendar.php#\" target=\"_blank\">EARCOS Teachers Conference</a> and <a href=\"https://sg.gafesummit.com/2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Apps for Education (GAFE) in Singapore</a>) and events designed with librarians in mind (e.g., the <a href=\"http://conference.ifla.org/\" target=\"_blank\">International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA)</a> and <a href=\"http://alaac15.ala.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the American Library Association (ALA)</a>), but the best for me are the hybrid kind -- where teacher-librarians get to meet and exchange ideas and experiences related to both teaching and to librarianship.  </p><p>Local network after-school meetings provide that kind of in-person contact.  Here in Singapore we have <a href=\"http://silcsing.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">ISLN</a> (International Schools Library Network of Singapore), as other cities do -- <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/klln\" target=\"_blank\">Kuala Lumpur</a>, Bangkok, <a href=\"http://www.hkgoldendragonawards.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong</a>, <a href=\"http://www.acamis.org/\" target=\"_blank\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sakuramedal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Japan</a>, etc.  But more dedicated time together with other teacher-librarians is definitely worth it.</p><p>In the region, there are several recurring events, e.g., the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/klln/Ji1Jsmb3bZw\" target=\"_blank\">Librarian Knowledge Sharing Workshop </a>(LKSW) (now coming up to its 4th year , back in Kuala Lumpur where it started); the <a href=\"http://www.schoollibrarianconnection.com/conferences\" target=\"_blank\">School Librarian Connection</a>, initiated last year in Hong Kong, up for repetition somewhere, perhaps Singapore; <a href=\"https://schoollibrarysymposium.wikispaces.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the Shanghai librarians</a> conference; and in Taiwan this November an EARCOS-sponsored weekend on <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B88y99PAnOIBYk1Bd2trMVNyR1E/view\" target=\"_blank\">Tech-Integrated Libraries</a>. </p><p>The large-scale version of these are the <a href=\"http://www.iasl-online.org/meetings/info.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Association of School Librarianship (IASL)</a> and the <a href=\"http://buttedeliteracy.drupalgardens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ECIS Triennial Librarians Conference</a> -- though timing and distance are sometimes a problem.</p><p>To give an idea of the range of ideas explored in the small-scale regional professional gatherings, see this summary sketch-note from the February 2015 <a href=\"http://blogs.shrewsbury.ac.th/lksw/presentations-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Librarian Knowledge Sharing Workshop</a> in Bangkok -- by <a href=\"http://www.maggieappleton.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maggie Appleton</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1439079324770_230572\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300297646_71\">\n<div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline\" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300297646_70\">\n<figure class=\"sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300297646_69\" style=\"max-width:908px;\">\n<button class=\"sqs-block-image-button lightbox\" data-description=\"\" data-lightbox-theme=\"\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300297646_68\">\n<span class=\"v6-visually-hidden\">View fullsize</span>\n<div class=\"image-block-wrapper\" data-animation-override=\"\" data-animation-role=\"image\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300297646_67\">\n<div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\" id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1754300297646_66\" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:128.52423095703125%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"loaded\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"908x1167\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-loader=\"sqs\" data-src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png\" data-stretch=\"false\" decoding=\"async\" elementtiming=\"system-image-block\" height=\"1167\" loading=\"lazy\" onload='this.classList.add(\"loaded\")' sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 100vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/551e9827e4b0a00742213303/1439168676527-VKK110WOOV8HZEUVQIC0/image-asset.png?format=2500w 2500w\" style=\"display:block;object-fit: cover;
