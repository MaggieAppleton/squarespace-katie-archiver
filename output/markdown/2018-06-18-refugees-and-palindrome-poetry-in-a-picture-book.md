[Brian Bilston](https://brianbilston.com/2016/03/23/refugees/) became popular on the internet \(especially Twitter\) when he published **a poem about refugees** \(which my colleague Philip Williams animated for a display in our libraries \([see Philip's video here\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTkFIhfowIc&feature=youtu.be) and [someone else illustrated here](http://www.signature-reads.com/2017/11/poetry-of-resistance-brian-bilston-refugees/)\).

What’s unusual about it is that it is meant to be read first one way and then in reverse. These are also known as [palindrome poems](http://poetrysociety.org.uk/) \(for another example, see this well-known video of one called [“The Lost Generation”](https://youtu.be/z92HQkRmhlc)\).

Barb Reid just showed me a 2018 Australian picture book which does the same thing - on the same topic of refugees. Luckily it's available on Book Depository [here](https://www.bookdepository.com/Room-on-Our-Rock-Kate-Temple-Rose-Terri-Baynton/9781742764108). Wish we had known about it earlier as it would be a great choice for our Bangkok Book Awards -- as the Singapore Red Dots have got it on theirs. \(Maybe next year for us...\)
