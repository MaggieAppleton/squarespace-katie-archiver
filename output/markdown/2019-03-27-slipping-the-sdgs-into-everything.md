The [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/) are spreading throughout the curriculum, not just at IB World Schools, but everywhere.

Last month on April 2nd \(International Children’s Book Day — the birthday of Hans Christian Andersen\) [the SDG Book Club](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sdgbookclub/) was launched at the Bologna Children’s Book Fair. The initiative is jointly sponsored by the United Nations, IFLA \(Int’l Federation of Library Associations\), IBBY \(Int’l Board on Books for Young People\), the IPA \(Int’l Publishers Association\), the International Booksellers Federation, and the Bologna Children’s Book Fair.
**Every month new booklists \(aimed at children aged 6-12\) — in the 6 languages of the UN: English, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and French — will be announced.**

The goal? **17 months to read 17 books, one per month until September 2020** \(which is when Moscow is hosting the 2020 biennial IBBY Conference\).

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanmao_\(comics\)): “The name Sanmao means "three hairs" in Chinese, or "thirty cents" \(a reference to his poverty\). While the character has undergone a number of transitions over time, he has always been drawn with the trademark three strands of hair, which implies malnutrition as a result of poverty.”

Well, the English list is okay, though “The Happy Prince” is maybe a weird choice. Or, should I say, an old choice? Was to increase the accessibility? \(Yes, “The Happy Prince” is widely available free on the internet.\) Was that a reason behind the Russian choices? i.e., Pushkin \(1799-1837\), Chekhov \(1860-1904\), and Marshak \(1887-1964\).

I’m also wondering about the Chinese choice of Mark Twain’s “The Prince and the Pauper.” Yes, a pauper is poor, but is it a well-known book in China?

In some ways, it would have been interesting to make one of the English choices a translation of a Chinese “Sanmao” story as that character is definitely a representation of poverty.

At NIST we have made little bookmarks to insert into books we have on display in order to highlight SDG connections, especially new books.

We also use our digital signage to highlight connections between books and SDGs — especially on special days \(Int’l Women’s Day\) and weeks \(Earth Day/Week\).

NB: Nadine Bailey has made one of her wow Libguides for the SDGs — see <https://library.wab.edu/SDG>.
