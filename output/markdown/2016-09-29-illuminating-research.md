Last month in Prague, I got the chance to dive deep with small groups of teacher-librarians on the concepts behind teaching research -- at the [School Librarian Connection conference](http://www.schoollibrarianconnection.com/prague-2016.html).

My preparation for the workshop began with [a survey](https://goo.gl/forms/MKkuil9iZNudEoJK2) \-- for both teachers and librarians\* -- and those questions provided the basic outline of my half-day sessions \(the morning one focused on primary school, the afternoon on secondary\).

Research models are the most obvious visual place to start.

Workshop participants responded to some models highlighted in my slides in extended table discussions and then by hand annotations on a wall chart -- as the slides below show.

Of particular interest was the new \(unpublished\) [UWCSEA East](http://www.uwcsea.edu.sg/) model, heavily influenced by two of our gurus: [Kath Murdoch for inquiry](http://www.kathmurdoch.com.au/), and [Cathryn Berger Kaye for service learning](http://www.cbkassociates.com/) \(e.g., her MISO \(Media / Interview / Survey / Observation\) approach\).

Kath does a lot of work with international schools, and I pointed out that both UWCSEA and our host, the International School of Prague, are thanked in the acknowledgements of her recent book, [The Power of Inquiry](http://www.kathmurdoch.com.au/shop/the-power-of-inquiry). Only one other school was familiar with Cathryn Berger Kaye's work, but raved about her as an on-site presenter and consultant.

We then considered overall metaphors for research, e.g., the journey, and the difference between skills and concepts -- before [mapping and discussing ones we felt were easier or harder](https://goo.gl/photos/Jjox8x9yNH6BhizL9) for particular age groups.

The full set of slides from my presentation are below. I ended the session by running through some of my favorite metaphors related to research.
