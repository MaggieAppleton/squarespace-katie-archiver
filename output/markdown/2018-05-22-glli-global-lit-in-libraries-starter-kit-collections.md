excerpt: Idea coming out of IASL 2018 in Turkey (thanks to Karen Van Drie) - every
  school library should have 2 books from each country.Â  She suggested over on Facebook
  that we get Follett to make/host the list.Instead I suggested using LibraryThing

Idea coming out of IASL 2018 in Turkey \(thanks to Karen Van Drie\) - every school library should have 2 books from each country. She suggested over on Facebook that we get Follett to make/host the list.

Instead I suggested using LibraryThing -- e.g., see this public crowd-source List for Children's Lit:
[http://www.librarything.com/.../Global-Lit-in-Libs...](http://www.librarything.com/list/18723/all/Global-Lit-in-Libs-Childrens-Lit-Starter-Kit-possibilities)

and one for YA Lit:
[http://www.librarything.com/.../Global-Lit-in-Libs-YA...](http://www.librarything.com/list/18722/all/Global-Lit-in-Libs-YA-Starter-Kit-possibilities)

As people add titles to this list, use the "Explain" feature to indicate which COUNTRY or CULTURE the book relates to -- and, if possible, in what way, e.g.,

\-- Content of the book, e.g., setting or characters
\-- Author's background
\-- Location of original publication
\-- Translation
\--------------------------------

GLLI already has some wonderful collections started: <http://www.librarything.com/catalog/glli>
