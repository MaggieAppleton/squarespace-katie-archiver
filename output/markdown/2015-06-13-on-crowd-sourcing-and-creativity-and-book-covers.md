For the past two years I have solved the problem of summer reading lists by crowd-sourcing recommendations from our community via "Summer Shelfies."

We set up a photo booth area in the library \(with help from the Art Dept. and Dave Caleb, one of our digital literacy coaches who is a serious photographer\) -- for backlit flashes against a white backdrop -- the kind of lighting that makes all of us look like models.

Individuals or whole classes line up with a book in hand and get captured on film. I then post the results to a Google+ Photo Album.

This year we asked for another possibility -- a \#bookface creation.
