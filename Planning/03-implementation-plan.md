# Implementation Plan

## Development Phases

The project is broken down into 4 distinct phases that can be tackled one by one, with each phase building upon the previous.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Site Analysis

**Goal**: Establish project foundation and understand the target site structure

### Tasks:

- [x] Set up Python virtual environment
- [x] Install core dependencies (Playwright, BeautifulSoup4, requests)
- [x] Create basic project structure with configuration
- [x] Analyze target site structure and identify content patterns
- [x] Implement basic site connectivity and health checks
- [x] Create logging and configuration system
- [x] Write initial tests for connectivity

### Deliverables:

- [x] Working Python environment with all dependencies
- [x] Site analysis report documenting URL patterns and content structure
- [x] Basic scraper that can connect to the site and identify blog posts
- [x] Configuration file for site-specific settings

### Success Criteria:

- Can successfully connect to https://www.thelibrarianedge.com/
- Can identify and list all blog post URLs
- Has proper error handling for network issues
- Generates detailed logs of operations

## Phase 2: Content Extraction Engine

**Goal**: Build robust content scraping with comprehensive data capture

### Tasks:

- [x] Implement blog post content extraction
- [x] Extract metadata (titles, dates, categories, tags)
- [x] Handle different post formats and layouts
- [x] Implement image discovery and URL collection
- [x] Extract internal and external links
- [x] Handle pagination and post discovery
- [x] Create data validation and cleaning functions
- [x] Implement respectful scraping with delays

### Deliverables:

- [x] Core scraping engine that extracts all post content
- [x] Metadata extraction with proper date parsing
- [x] Image and asset discovery system
- [x] Data validation and cleaning pipeline

### Success Criteria:

- Extracts complete content from all blog posts
- Captures all metadata accurately
- Identifies all images and media files
- Handles edge cases and malformed content gracefully
- Respects rate limits and doesn't overwhelm the server

## Phase 3: Multi-Format Output Generation

**Goal**: Generate JSON, Markdown, and HTML archives from scraped data

### Tasks:

- [x] Design and implement JSON data structure
- [x] Create JSON archive with full metadata
- [x] Implement Markdown conversion with frontmatter
- [x] Build static HTML generator with preserved styling
- [x] Download and organize image files locally
- [x] Create proper directory structure for outputs
- [x] Implement file naming conventions and organization
- [x] Add output validation and integrity checks

### Deliverables:

- [x] JSON archive with structured data
- [x] Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- [x] Static HTML site with preserved styling
- [x] Local image archive with proper linking
- [x] Output validation system

### Success Criteria:

- JSON is valid and contains all scraped data
- Markdown files are properly formatted and readable
- HTML archive is browsable offline
- All images are downloaded and linked correctly
- Outputs can be used for migration to other platforms

## Phase 4: Enhancement & Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Add robustness, resumability, and comprehensive testing

### Tasks:

- [x] Implement resumable scraping (save progress, handle interruptions)
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [x] Create detailed progress reporting and status updates
- [x] Implement incremental updates (detect new/changed posts)
- [x] Add comprehensive test suite
- [x] Create user documentation and usage guide
- [x] Implement backup and versioning for outputs
- [x] Performance optimization and memory efficiency improvements

### Deliverables:

- [x] Robust, production-ready scraper
- [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] User documentation and setup guide
- [x] Incremental update capability
- [x] Performance benchmarks and optimization

### Success Criteria:

- [x] Can recover from network interruptions gracefully
- [x] Provides real-time progress updates
- [x] Can detect and scrape only new/changed content
- [x] Has comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Includes clear documentation for future use
- [x] Performs efficiently on large blogs
