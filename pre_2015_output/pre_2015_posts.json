See, for instance, this posting excerpt:\n\n\"Don't sell me a product, tell me a story!\" from The Intuitive Life Business Blog\n\nMarketing through telling stories doesn't stop there, it\n\ninfuses all that you do to market yourself and your business.\n\nConsider two of my favorite business authors, Tom Peters and Jim\n\nCollins. One of them is focused on participating in the business of\n\nbusiness, of sharing his evolving story and his view of which\n\nbusinesses are and aren't successful, while the other is locked away in\n\nhis ivory tower, selling products and doing research that he'll share\n\nwhen his next book is published. Which is which? You tell me: visit\n\nTom Peters' Web site\n\nand\n\nJim Collins' Web site\n\nfor yourself. The difference is glaringly obvious.\n\nYes, the power of blogs is in the collaborative story.\n\nFrom another business blog, another posting (\n\nNaked Conversations: Story Telling v. Product Selling\n\n) comes this comment about speakers at conferences and how the best ones tell stories:\n\nMalcolm Gladwell was our favorite last year.  He was selling his book, but he didn't talk much about his book.\n\nA case of showing what a good storyteller he was, rather than telling people he was. Of course, Gladwell has been a favorite of mine for years -- from the days when he was just in The New Yorker and I would rip his articles out to save.\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\nstorytelling\n\n,\n\nbusiness\n\n,\n\nnarrative",

      "content": "Joshua Schachter, from del.icio.us, gave a talk\n\nat a future web apps summit that\n\nSimon Willison\n\nattended -- and took notes on. They're wonderful snippets of thought relating to del.icio.us, RSS, and tagging (as well as more techie concerns).\n\nHere are the bits that made me either nod my head in approval or mentally tag for more consideration:\n\nWhen you chose what to build, solve a problem you have yourself so you can be\n\nsure to understand it. Passion counts.\n\nAggregation is often a focus of attention (latest, most active, etc.)\n\nAs the population gets larger, the bias drifts; del.icio.us/popular becomes\n\nless interesting to the original community members. Work out ways to let the\n\nsystem fragment in to different areas of attention.\n\nTagging is mostly user interface - a way for people to recall things, what\n\nthey were thinking about when they saved it. Fairly useful for recall, OK for\n\ndiscovery, terrible for distribution (where publishers add as many tags as\n\npossible to get it in lots of boxes).\n\nAutomatic tags lose a lot - doesn't help the user really achieve their goals.\n\nThat's why the \"add to del.icio.us\" badges don't let you suggest tags.\n\nValue in Delicious is in the \"attention\" - auto-tagging detracts from this.\n\nMake users do the minimum amount of work. But make them do something.\n\nYou have to speak the user's language. \"Bookmarks\" are what you call them if\n\nyou use Netscape of Firefox - most users these days know the term \"favourite\"\n\ninstead. Half of his population (? users) didn't know what a bookmark was.\n\nAnd here's a line that made me -- as a librarian -- stop and stare:\n\n\"Beware librarians\" - some people want to give tags a specific, underlying\n\nmeaning. Don't let them.\n\nCome on...\n\nAnyway, his comment re tagging as most useful for recall -- for the person who tagged it -- reminded me of Roger Schank's\n\n\"Tell Me A Story: Narrative and Intelligence\"\n\n(1990), a book I keep returning to in thinking about tagging as well as cataloging (yes, the librarian kind).\n\nHere's an excerpt from the foreword by Gary Saul Morson, summarizing Schank's argument:\n\n\"What enables ... people to respond\n\nintelligently\n\n?  The answer, for Schank, is that they have previously mulled over their experiences and\n\nlabeled\n\nthem in multiple interesting ways.  From a sequence of experiences they have constructed a narrative; they have reflected on this narrative and found a number of ways in which it is significant; and in so doing, their memory has attached several labels to the story, which allow them to recall the story when another narrative suggests similar labels.  Once the earlier story is recalled, these people can reflect on pertinent comparisons with the current situation.  Present wisdom depends on earlier indexing.\n\nIn effect, then the real moment of intelligence occurs\n\nnot\n\n(or not only) when one is reminded of the pertinent story, but when the pertinent story was stored in memory.  Intelligence occurs\n\nearlier\n\n.  It is closely related to good indexing.\"\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\ntags\n\n,\n\ntagging\n\n,\n\nattention_economy\n\n,\n\nlibrarian\n\n,\n\nSchank",

      "content": "Refreshing report in the Guardian (UK) --\n\n\"Another Hard Day in the Library\"\n\n-- earlier this month from Germaine Greer and other academics about how they really spent their university days and the long-term benefits of NOT forcing students to attend lectures and tutorials (as Oxford is threatening to do via contracts with the students).\n\nI always felt college was mainly four interesting walls within which to grow for four years. Greer says it better:\n\nKids don't go to university to sit at the feet of their elders and betters; they go to university to meet each other.... Because this is what uni is, the first time young people have their own collective space to organise or disorganise as they please.... Dragooning undergraduates would be to delay their maturation still further, so that they never achieve the autonomy on which our whole political system should be based.\n\nMade me think about the importance of young people having \"their own collective space\" online to \"organise or disorganise as they please\" -- and the need for human attention structures.   Lanham in his article on general education in the digital age (see yesterday's posting) makes the point that \"considered on the largest scale, the undergraduate curriculum is an attention-structure.\"\n\nGreer also argues that incompetent teachers are often far more valuable than good ones -- because they make you react to their incompetence -- and hence move you further along towards your own competence.\n\n\"Surely not!\" is a more salutary reaction to a statement from a teacher than \"Precisely\". As I used to say to my students, \"\n\nConfusion is the most productive state of mind. Respect your confusions. Don't let me waft them away\n\n.\"\n\nCarol Kuhlthau\n\nwould surely agree.\n\nGreer also makes a case for lectures being replaced by digital multimedia versions:\n\nIn 2006, it would make more sense to issue the lectures on DVD, and spend the hour in the lecture room dealing with student's questions.  In my day, students were supposed to be critical listeners.... The very best teacher is the one who really enjoys being made to look a fool by a student.\n\nLectures are a misshapen survival of medieval pedagogy, which took authority  as absolute and understood the teacher's sole duty to be that of expounding it.  Lectures have no place in a system based on critical thinking....\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\ninformation literacy\n\n,\n\nuniversity\n\n,\n\nteaching",

The farmer called each of his stacked enterprises\n\na \"holon\"\n\n, a word (Pollan explains) originating with\n\nArthur Koestler\n\nand meaning an entity that is both self-contained and a dependent part of a bigger system.\n\nFor example, one holon on his farm is to have cows graze a new pasture every day, with another holon being to have chickens feed in that same field three days later in order to eat the larvae just hatched in the cowpats.  The farmer described himself as the orchestra conductor, \"making sure everybody's in the right place at the right time\".\n\nI'd like to think of the school library as a holon -- just as every primary school classroom and the other specialist lessons are holons -- each self-contained and yet part of an interrelated system, with collaboration and communication between teachers and teacher-librarians necessary to make sure that the flow of intellectual nutrition is gathered at exactly the best moment.\n\nSo who's the orchestra conductor?  The curriculum coordinator?  Better yet, the teacher-librarian...\n\nTags:\n\neducation\n\n,\n\nschool_librarians\n\n,\n\nfarms\n\n,\n\nfood",

His narrative of how he explores that question is an excellent model of inquiry-based learning -- in adults, in the real world, on a topic that definitely addresses the big 'so what?' criterium.\n\nDid you know that food production burns almost 1/5 of the petroleum consumed in the US?  Just as much as cars consume... \"And how could it come to pass that a fast-food burger produced from corn and fossil actually costs less than a burger produced from grass and sunlight?\"  By the way, his website provides access to all of his articles over the years, many of which contain ideas pulled together in this book.\n\nI would love to see such a book re-written for upper primary and middle school students (much like\n\nEric Schlosser\n\ntook his\n\nFast Food Nation\n\nand re-wrote it as\n\nChew on This\n\nwith Charles Wilson -- not to mention\n\nthe movie\n\njust coming out).\n\nPollan tunes in, finds out, sorts out, goes further, make conclusions, takes action, and then shares and reflects -- in continual loops (to use\n\nKath Murdoch's model\n\nof inquiry -- though any one could be used, e.g.,\n\nthe Big6\n\n,\n\nPLUS\n\n, etc.) -- about food chains, a topic included in many curricula.\n\nHaving kids see that adults get excited about big questions and pursue them is so important.   Unfortunately, I haven't seen all that many primary school teachers who are committed to inquiry projects of their own -- or perhaps I should say I haven't seen many teachers share their outside passions within the school.   Perhaps in my new school come August I'll provide display space in the library for teachers to do just that -- share their reading interests and personal ongoing inquiries.\n\nTags:\n\neducation\n\n,\n\ninquiry_based_learning\n\n,\n\nfood",

      "content": "In my school library I put different quotes related to reading and books on shelfmarkers, hoping the kids will stop to read and think as they browse.  Late Friday afternoon a 5th grade girl caught me as I was rushing from one task to another and said, \"Did you make those shelfmarkers?\"  \"Yes,\" I said and started to move away.  \"But, what about this one that says 'Stories can save your life'?\" she continued, \"How can that be true?\"  I stopped.  My brain was really on something else and I searched for the simplest answer.  \"Well, of course they can.  Maybe you read a novel about survival and you learn something that later helps you survive. And think of all the non-fiction books that have important information in them.\"  The look on her face told me she wasn't completely convinced, but I moved on, even though I knew I hadn't handled the moment well at all.\n\nThen today I happened to read\n\nJudith Ridge's article in the March 2006 issue of the Horn Book\n\non the books of Boori Monti Pryor, an Aboriginal, and his white partner, Meme McDonald, in which the power of that quote in the context of Aboriginal storytelling was addressed.\n\nIt’s a fascinating concept of story — that what is most powerful lies in what cannot be said. The experience made Meme realize that “stories are our lifeblood — they instruct us how to live and how to be and what visions to hold true. They’re fundamental to the happiness of our lives, so they’re very precious. So in that sense, I think if you start to regard stories as an absolute essential of life, rather than a distraction from life, then how you evolve them and in what context, what respect you have for the source of that story, becomes very important whatever culture you come from.”\n\nThe point of all of this, of course, is that this new — or, rather, most ancient — way of creating stories isn’t just an issue for Aboriginal people. In fact, it’s not even just about story — it’s about life and culture and creating a society based on principles of respect and collaboration.\n\nAs for the quote, \"Stories can save your life\", one frequently cited source for it is\n\nTim O'Brien\n\n's book \"The Things They Carried\", though of course Sharhazad in \"1001 Arabian Nights\" is the best example, as\n\nSusan Fletcher\n\ndiscusses on her website in connection with her book \"Shadow Spinner\".\n\nI can't wait to get back to school and find that girl again.

They start by scanning an entire set of (hardcopy) periodicals in a library, no matter what field they are in (e.g., engineers are instructed to not overlook Women's Wear Daily or Art in America), looking for patterns of themes or topics relating to change and new innovations.   Then they move onto online resources (and she provides a good list), again, across a wide range of interests.\n\nThis type of scanning outside one's forte is exactly what I think all those involved in education should always be doing.\n\nI particularly like her recommendation:  \"Another strategy is identifying the websites of the literate lunatic fringe -- or genius fringe -- and monitoring their blogs (weblogs).\"\n\nYes, checking out the edge is always interesting.  So what websites qualify as  the literate genius fringe in the field of teaching and librarianship??

      "content": "For all the virtues of virtual connections, there's nothing like a few days of face-to-face with large numbers of peers for some mental and social expansion.\n\nLast week I had two such valuable experiences at overlapping conferences:\n\nthe\n\nEARCOS (East Asia Regional Council of Overseas Schools) 2007 Teachers' Conference:\n\nOne World, One Future\n\nin Bangkok\n\nthe\n\nIBAP (International Baccalaureate Asia Pacific) Teachers' Convention 2007:\n\nInformation Literacy Across the IB Programmes\n\nin Singapore.\n\n[The EARCOS one is listed on\n\nHitchkr\n\n(a compendium of blog postings on different conferences) but not the IBAP one.  As for handouts to download, the IB ones are listed on the conference website given above, but for the EARCOS ones you have to drill down into the sub-pages, e.g., the\n\nWorkshop Presenters\n\npage, and look under each name.]\n\nI'm writing up my notes\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n\n, but the focal point of both experiences was\n\non the form and content of the future that educators, in particular, need to start acting upon\n\n-- and each conference provided an excellent guru.\n\nTechnology\n\nis obviously the form, but while anyone can get up and rant about exponential growth and the need to embrace change, not just anyone can show us workable paths and original thinking.\n\nAt the IBAP conference,\n\nStephen Heppell\n\n(check out\n\nhis bio\n\n, if you've never heard of him) pulled up example after example from his crowded Mac desktop screen showing us how he's involved in getting students and teachers to learn collaboratively using the latest technology (see\n\nnotschool.net\n\n,\n\nteachers.tv\n\n, the\n\nlearnometer\n\nproject, the \"\n\nbe very afraid\n\n\" film series, etc.).  His presentation lived up to the tags on his website: learning, ingenuity, research, policy, design, technology, and delight.  (I'll blog more about his ideas in a separate posting.)\n\nGlobal issues\n\nare the content.  The appearance of\n\nJean-Francois Rischard\n\n, author of the book\n\nHigh Noon\n\n, at the EARCOS conference was very timely. Consensus on the pressing problem of global warming has coalesced (thanks in part to Al Gore's movie) over the past several months, so it was wonderful to hear from someone who has been thinking seriously about the problem -- and even bigger ones -- for several years.\n\nHis overall message was that we need to come up with a new methodology of global problem-solving because the problems now facing the world must be resolved by countries working together. Like Heppell, Rischard is someone who has been involved in the system he's critiquing, as he used to work for the World Bank and is very knowledgeable about the current international organizations available.  (I'll blog more about his ideas in a separate posting.)\n\nThe popular meme that was killed for me, thanks to these conferences, was\n\nMarc Prensky\n\n's\n\ndigital immigrant/digital native\n\ndivide.  I've been guilty of spreading it myself, but, I'm sorry -- given the rate of change, doesn't the divide continually shift?  Is it meaningful?  Each cohort born will be exposed to some technology at a younger age than those born a few years before.  There was a \"Student Perspectives on IT and Education\" forum at the IBAP conference and the teens who participated (from two different international schools in Singapore) admitted they marvel at how younger kids are utilizing technology at a younger age than they did, e.g., mobile phones.  The term \"digital natives\" did not resonate with them, though they did gripe that many of their teachers were not as digitally fluent as they were.  I much prefer the idea of a digital literacy or fluency continuum, regardless of age.\n\nA focus on an age definition of \"digital natives\" (e.g., born after 1973 or whatever the current year-marker is) also ignores the very real economic digital divide.  To speak sweepingly of a whole digital generation, when many children have yet to touch a digital device, is misleading.\n\nBrain research is strongly linked to this concept of \"digital natives\" and \"digital immigrants\".  I must go back and review the latest reports because almost every speaker (especially that stand-up comic/evangelist preacher\n\nIan Jukes\n\n) made it sound like kids' brains have eternal neuro-plasticity while ours are hopelessly hardwired.   I'm sure I've recently read about the window of neural-plasticity staying open (longer), e.g., that the elderly can even continue to build new neural pathways if they keep mentally fit (the old 'use-it or lost-it' saying).  Anyway, something to look up later.\n\nAs I've mentioned Jukes, I also want to point out something that strikes me as odd about his\n\nblog\n\n.  I've clicked on at least six different postings (see, for example,\n\nVideo Games Focus on Exercising Brain\n\nand\n\nThe Handwriting is on the Wall\n\n) and they appear to be his comments on an article, for which he provides a link at the bottom of the posting.  BUT, when you go to the article, it's word-for-word the same as his posting.  So he seems to be posting whole copies of article texts on his blog with no attribution (neither publication nor author) on the blog itself -- though he does provide a link to the article (which doesn't always work though -- e.g., several link to expired articles (\n\nStudents use IM Lingo in Essays\n\nand\n\nShoes Track Children Using GPS\n\n) and one posting appears to be an image so you can't actually click on the link (\n\n1867 Nanomachine Now Reality\n\n)).  My impression of him was as an energetic re-packager of ideas (I had heard them all before from other sources) and his blog makes it look like he doesn't even do that very well.\n\nWould we really let students copy an article on their blog without indicating that it was NOT their own words in the posting, even if they did provide a link at the end to the real article?  Must review online ethical etiquette sometime...\n\nMore thoughts in separate postings...\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\nEARCOS07\n\n,\n\nIBAP07\n\n,\n\ndigital literacy\n\n,\n\nfuture\n\n,\n\nconferences\n\n,\n\ntechnology",

The workshop leader was gently trying to get us to come up with questions more based in the kids' everyday reality, e.g.,\n\nwhat diseases are in my community and what I can do about it?\n\nBut what if malaria isn't rampant in our community?

(see\n\nprevious postin\n\ng)\n\nThe 20 most pressing problems, according to Rischard:\n\nSharing our planet: Issues involving the global commons\n\n1. Global warming\n\n2. Biodiversity and ecosystem losses\n\n3. Fisheries depletion\n\n4. Deforestation\n\n5. Water deficits\n\n6. Maritime safety and pollution\n\nSharing our humanity: Issues requiring a global commitment\n\n7. Massive step-up in the fight against poverty\n\n8. Peacekeeping, conflict prevention, combating terrorism\n\n9. Education for all\n\n10. Global infectious diseases\n\n11. Digital Divide\n\n12. Natural disaster prevention and mitigation\n\nSharing our rulebook: Issues needing a global regulatory approach\n\n13. Reinventing taxation for the 21st century\n\n14. Biotechnology rules\n\n15. Global financial architecture\n\n16. Illegal drugs\n\n17. Trade, investment, and competition rules\n\n18. Intellectual property rights\n\n19. E-commerce rules\n\n20. International labor and migration rules\n\n[both images, above right, taken from www.nais.org]\n\nRischard stresses that these problems require long-term thinking and commitment, something democracies cannot easily deliver (due to electoral pressures). Nation-states, territorial by definition, are also inadequate, given the inherently global nature of the problems. He proposes the establishment of\n\nGlobal Issues Networks\n\n, consisting of experts from various countries appointed by world leaders. These experts will work to extract rough consensus for norms and standards for all countries to adhere to in the interest of the whole world.\n\nRischard said you'd have to tell these experts that they were working for humanity with an eye to each of them winning a Nobel prize for their work. (I love that idea of appealing to their pride!)\n\nThe other thing we'd have to do, he said, is to work towards developing the mindset of global citizenship -- which is where education steps in.\n\nThere are several educational projects, based on Rischard's book and his advocacy, now in place, with more likely.\n\nIn the US, the\n\nNAIS\n\n(National Association of Independent Schools) has a program called\n\nChallenge 20/20\n\n, which pairs schools in the US with a school elsewhere in the world to work on creative global problem solving.\n\nIn Europe there are\n\nGIN (Global Issues Network)\n\ngroups starting up in international schools.  Clayton Lewis, head of the\n\nInternational School of Luxembourg\n\n, has been working with Rischard and a GIN conference is planned for next year.\n\nHere in Asia\n\nWAB (Western Academy of Beijing)\n\nhas a program in place called GIG (Global Issues Group) and they are planning to host a (student?) conference in March 2008.\n\nRischard said he is also meeting with the\n\nIBO\n\nto discuss how his framework could be spread throughout their school network.\n\nIt's all exciting stuff.  Our school already has a well-developed Global Concerns program, but I can see the benefit of becoming part of the Global Issues Network.\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\nEARCOS07\n\n,\n\nglobal issues\n\n,\n\ninternational schools",

However, those of us in a school with an explicit inquiry-based learning framework in place often feel ahead of the game.\n\nFor example, at\n\nDoug Johnson\n\n's\n\nEARCOS 2007\n\npre-conference workshop for teacher/librarians on\n\nDesigning Projects Students (and Teachers) Love\n\n, those of us at\n\nPYP\n\nschools felt his 4-level Research Question Rubric -- where Level 1 asks for\n\nsimple recall\n\n, Level 2 asks\n\na specific question\n\n, Level 3 asks for\n\npersonal response\n\n, and Level 4 includes\n\na call for action\n\n-- simply reflected different stages in the inquiry process.\n\nUsing\n\nKath Murdoch's inquiry cycle model\n\n, a Level 1 question is equivalent to\n\nTuning In\n\n, a Level 2 question might be\n\nFinding Out\n\nor\n\nSorting Out\n\n, a Level 3 question reflects\n\nGoing Further\n\nor\n\nMaking Conclusions\n\n, and a Level 4 question falls under\n\nTaking Action\n\nfollowed by\n\nSharing\n\n/\n\nReflection\n\n. So, while he was trying to get us to generate a Level 4 question to assign to students, we all felt the rubric was just a spiral students would move along themselves in any one project or unit of inquiry.\n\nWhen the question of appropriate assessment (or assignments) came up at the\n\nIBAP conference\n\n,\n\nProf. Stephen Heppell\n\nhad a few great substitutions he threw out to us (likes scraps to hungry animals) -- especially after the\n\nIB Diploma\n\nstudents participating in the forum complained about two years of effort being assessed in a 2-hour\n\nhandwritten\n\nexam worth 80% of their grade.\n\n~ instead of an 80% exam, why not require a 3-nation collaborative task for students?\n\n~ instead of assigning a 1,500 word essay, why not require either a) scripting and posting a 3-minute podcast, or b) managing an online discussion for a week, or c) annotating 10 website links?\n\n~ instead of bemoaning the availability of \"free online essays\" for students to pinch, why not assign the task of choosing 4 \"free online essays\" and critiquing them, and then improving on one of them?\n\nI mentioned this to my daughter and a friend, both of whom are about to take the\n\nIGCSE\n\n/\n\nGCSE\n\nexams, and they leapt onto the last idea, saying how useful it would be for them to critique other people's essays -- to internalize the examiners' rubric and understand more fully what it is they are being asked to perform.\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\nEARCOS07\n\n,\n\nassessment\n\n,\n\nquestions\n\n,\n\nIBAP07\n\n,\n\ninformation literacy\n\n,\n\nplagiarism\n\n,\n\ninquiry model",

Returning to Singapore and immediately having to find a new place to live in a hot property market ? (downsizing is painful)  ... Instead I'll suggest the tactic of slow blogging (cf:\n\nslow food\n\nand\n\nslow schools\n\n).\n\nI certainly digest material slowly.  There's that fear of being forever a lurker.  Still learning, but not quick to interact.  I'm reminded of an article (that I can't provide a link to at the moment) I had to read once about Aborigine children in Australia and how they prefer long periods of observing in the classroom before engaging.  For them public mistakes are worse than delay or inactivity.  Though the teacher might perceive them as dreaming or not on task, they instead act upon a greater requirement to survey what is going on.  Slow but solid absorption.\n\nHowever, the time to start writing is\n\nnow\n\n.  I've signed up to do a workshop at\n\nTeachIT\n\nwith my good friend (and fellow teacher-librarian)\n\nBarb Philip\n\n.  Just a 75 minute workshop -- but for our general international school peers (argh!) here in Singapore on a Saturday in November.\n\nSocial Software -- in school and life\n\nSee how two teacher-librarians have experimented with free (and almost free) internet software to help them collect, organize, and share information online -- and play with these Web 2.0 tools yourself. Guaranteed to get you thinking how you might use them in your classroom as well as for professional networking and personal projects. The sampler will include wikis, social bookmarking, online catalogs, blogs, RSS readers, photo and document sharing, and customized search engines.\n\nIt got a bit truncated in the official line-up, but that was our original description.\n\nIt's a deja-vu experience for me, as that's what I did 18 months ago with\n\nBeth Gourley\n\n.  We signed up to do a workshop for fellow teacher-librarians at\n\nEARCOS\n\n2006.  You never learn anything until you volunteer to present it.  Beth and I threw our combined learning into a wiki, which is still out there --\n\nLibraryTails\n\n-- and surprisingly not that out-of-date.  Barb and I agree we definitely need to pool our content online beforehand.  This workshop will be better than the last one in that it's hands-on.  So we just need a launchpad so people can start playing.  Barb's going to set up a MySpace for us, while I'm going to use this blog to focus on some of our experiences and ideas.\n\nPoem I read recently -- by Eve Merriam:\n\nA Lazy Thought\n\nThere go the grown ups\n\nTo the office,\n\nTo the store.\n\nSubway rush,\n\nTraffic crush;\n\nHurry, scurry,\n\nWorry, flurry.\n\nNo wonder\n\nGrown ups\n\nDon't grow up\n\nAny more.\n\nIt takes a lot\n\nOf slow\n\nTo grow.",

Flickr has a tour available on its home page, which is one place to start.\n\nAnother way is to just start searching for photos on Flickr, e.g.,\n\nphotos tagged \"Singapore\"\n\nor\n\nphotos including the word \"Hmong\"\n\n.\n\nFlickr also allows you to put photos in Sets and then to put Sets into Collections.  For instance, I have a Collection called\n\nUWCSEA Primary Library\n\n, which contains 8 sets, e.g.,\n\nWriters' Camp 2007: Telunas Beach\n\nand\n\n07-08 UWCSEA Primary Library Displays\n\n.  It's my way of recording what I do in the library. I have another collection called\n\nOther School Libraries\n\nwhere I keep sets of photos of libraries taken on professional peer visits.\n\nNB: I can control who can see any photo by specifying its privacy level -- public, friend, or family.\n\nBy becoming \"friends\" with people and adding them to your Contact list, then you can automatically see when they upload new photos.   For instance, Barb just became a grandmother and when I login to Flickr, I can see\n\nthe latest photos she's uploaded of the baby\n\n-- because she's one of my Contacts.\n\nThere are also Groups you can join.  I'm thinking of joining the\n\n365 Library Days Project\n\n-- where you are supposed to take one photo a day of your library for a year and post them on Flickr.  Search for groups that interest you.   Take a look at\n\nall these Singapore groups on Flickr\n\n.\n\nHow could Flickr be used in the classroom?  Read about\n\nPhoto Sharing in Education\n\nin the\n\nTeaching Hacks Wiki\n\n(which has enough material there to keep you occupied for another Saturday or two).\n\nPeople are doing\n\nall kinds of fun stuff with Flickr\n\n.

      "content": "Seen\n\na list of all the Google products\n\nlately?  It's impressive.  (Check out\n\nthe [French] map of these products\n\nand how they relate to one another, though -- mind -- it's as enormous as Google's influence....  I prefer\n\nthe more impressionistic (and English) map of Googleland\n\n....)\n\nMaybe Google is taking over the world, but I'm still a happy user.\n\nMy favorite tools are\n\nGmail\n\n,\n\nGoogle Reader\n\n,\n\niGoogle\n\n, and\n\nGoogle Notebook\n\n.\n\nI love\n\nGmail\n\nwith its ability to tag e-mails with multiple labels -- effectively allowing them to \"live\" in multiple folders -- makes managing the inbox so easy.  (I don't know if any of you subscribe to multiple listservs -- but Gmail makes it easy to set up filters and automatically tag/label posts as they come in -- have a read here about\n\nhow I manage my listserv traffic using a second Gmail account\n\n, if you're interested...)\n\nEven if you don't use Gmail, you can still get a Google account and access their other products.\n\nGoogleReader\n\nis hard to show off -- as you would have to be logged into my Google account to see my (170+) feeds and my pile of reading.  But they now allow you to identify items for sharing.  This is the public webpage of\n\nmy GoogleReader shared items\n\n.  They also allow you to post clips of your most recent shared items on your blog (so you should see them on the upper left of my blog page).\n\niGoogle\n\nis Google's home page option for you.  Again, you can't see mine unless you log in as me.  But I can tell you it's got feeds from my various social software tools -- my LibraryThing catalog, my del.icio.us account, my GoogleDocs, my Gmail, my GoogleReader, etc., plus a \"to-do\" list that I maintain.\n\nGoogleNotebook\n\nallows me to make notes and mark websites for later reading/action.  I can share these notebooks, e.g., Barb and I shared one in planning for this workshop.  While we have read/write privileges, GoogleNotebook also has an option to make a notebook public -- so you can see what we have in our notebook called\n\nSocial Software Workshop\n\n.\n\nWill Richardson over on\n\nWeblogg-ed\n\nrecently asked the blogosphere:\n\nWhat’s Your Process?\n\nSeriously. I want to know. What do you do when you read a couple of sentences in a post or article that really resonate? How do you capture and organize those snippets? What tools do you use? How often do you recall those sentences, access them? How do you search for them? Is your process working?\n\nLots of people answered him -- and I couldn't resist adding\n\nmy two cents\n\n:\n\nLike so many others posting here, I’m a huge fan of Google Notebook, available wherever there’s internet access, from any machine. Definitely download the Firefox extension, so with one right-click, you can pop in a snippet and a link.\n\nWhen I go through my Google Reader inbox, I make entries in my various Google Notebooks of things I want to follow up on or want to make notes on (though, yes, I also use del.icio.us to log websites, as well as diigo).\n\nI maintain a number of notebooks and it’s easy to move notes from one to the other. For example, one is for “Books of interest” — definitely useful before heading to the library or bookstore. Another notebook holds my “Notes on books read”. Yet another is “Articles to think about”.\n\nAs a teacher-librarian, I work with a variety of classes on different units of inquiry — and I create a new Google notebook for each one. It lets me build up ideas, links, etc. to sort through later.\n\nIn a couple of weeks a friend and I are doing a short workshop on Social Software for fellow teachers and we’re using a “shared” Google notebook to log and comment on sites, ideas, quotes, etc.\n\nMy “General” notebook is useful for logging things like airplane ticket reservations (so I don’t have to wait for the confirmation e-mail to arrive in my in-box — I just clip the relevant information and feel safe to leave the ticketing webpage).\n\nI use iGoogle as my personal homepage so my Google notebooks are readily available (along with my Gmail, my Google Reader, etc.) Yes, I’m a Google fan…\n\nGoogleDocs\n\nis another way to collect and share information.  You can upload text documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoint presentations -- and invite other people to become collaborators.  Barb and I also use it frequently to give each other access to documents -- rather than attaching Word documents to e-mails.\n\nNov. 19:\n\nJust discovered that those clever folks at\n\nThe Common Craft Show\n\nhave produced one of their super-simple explanatory videos for GoogleDocs:\n\nGoogleDocs in Plain English\n\nThe folks at Google are constantly coming up with new ideas (during that 20% of their free-thinking time).\n\nGoogle Custom Search Engines\n\n(though note, they're not the only ones out there) are a powerful tool, especially for teachers/librarians who want to enforce some quality control on students' searching. You get to specify exactly which sites and/or pages will be searched. I've already created several for my primary school students, e.g.,\n\nMs. Day's General Search Engine for Kids\n\nand an\n\nAztec Search Engine\n\n.  Both only search sites that I am confident have information at the level of primary school students.\n\nAnother more recent addition to the field is\n\nDeliGoo\n\n, a\n\ndel.icio.us\n\nsearch engine. It's a Firefox extension that allows you to search just the websites tagged in a del.icio.us account, e.g.,",

      "title": "What is \"Social Graph-Based Search\"? -- and will it overtake Google?",
      "content": "Robert Scoble,\n\na well-known Internet guru, makes some strong arguments that Google is going to be left behind in terms of search (over the next few years) because its core strength is about search engine optimization techniques (i.e., how people can tweak their webpage to come out higher in the rankings because of knowing how the search algorithm works).\n\nInstead Scoble believes social graph-based searching -- or tapping into people-based networks for information -- will reign supreme in the search world, and he discusses three in particular:\n\nMahalo\n\n,\n\nFacebook\n\n, and\n\nTechMeme\n\n.\n\nWatch these three video tutorials of Robert Scoble talking about \"Social Graph-Based Search\":\n\nPart I\n\nPart II\n\nPart III\n\nHe talks about a fabric of trust -- makes me think of librarians as a reliable fabric in society, providing trusted information ....\n\nScoble asks, what if everyone has their own Mahalo?  Our own network of  \"people-based systems\"....\n\nYou'll probably have heard of\n\nFacebook\n\n(if not, see\n\nits Wikipedia entry\n\n-- and consider the fact that it has almost 50 million active users and Microsoft just paid $240m for a 1.6% stake in the company).\n\nTechMeme\n\nis more for technology addicts, while\n\nMahalo\n\n, subtitled \"Human-Powered Search\",  is designed for the general public.\n\nI think Mahalo has a lot of potential.  Their \"guides\" (as they call the people who put their pages together) are basically creating what librarians call \"pathfinders\" -- a summary of the best links on a particular topic.  See, for example,\n\nMahalo's School Subjects\n\nlist.  Students should find some of those pages quite useful, e.g., the page on\n\nHamlet\n\nhas everything you might need.... same goes for the page on\n\nIan McEwa\n\nn.....  I know the book club I belong to would find the\n\nthe Authors and Writers pages\n\nuseful...\n\nMahalo also has some good intro \"how-to\" pages on technology, e.g.,\n\nHow to Use del.icio.us Like a Pro\n\nHow to Choose a Photo Sharing Site for Newbies\n\nHow to Use Flickr Like a Pro\n\nI read\n\na recent article/interview with Jason Calacanis\n\n, the founder of Mahalo.\n\nHis plan was devilishly clever: He would create a human-powered search engine that builds out prefab responses to the most popular search terms. He would shoot for the top 30%, or about 15,000 terms, to effectively skim the cream from the entire search business. Mahalo would deliver results for searches like \"Paris Hilton,\" \"iPod,\" and \"Bill Gates,\" but not for your local high-school football team or childhood sweetheart. And because those results would be prepared by humans, sifted and sorted and condensed for maximum relevance, users would no longer be faced with 10 million hits, as they are with Google, but with a few dozen. Mahalo would be a search engine for people who don't like to search.\n\nEvidently Mahalo has about 60 employees so far.\n\nMost of Calacanis's employees are young out-of-work novelists, screenwriters, musicians, artists, and actors--info addicts happy to earn $35,000 a year plus health benefits by searching the Web rather than shelving books at Barnes & Noble or slinging chai lattes at Starbucks. Calacanis has promised them 15% of the company when and if it goes public, with the investors getting a third and Calacanis keeping the rest.\n\n(Why doesn't he try to hire librarians, who are trained in searching and evaluating information??)\n\nAnyway, if you like Mahalo, you might also look at\n\nSquidoo\n\n-- which is openly social (like Wikipedia, meaning anyone can create pages).  Here's how they describe themselves:\n\nSquidoo\n\nis a website hosting hundreds of thousands of lenses. Each lens is one person's look at something online. Your take on football or business or the best thai food in town.   Lenses are\n\nfree\n\n.",

      "content": "Had the chance to hear Helen Reynolds,\n\nTeacher-Librarian of the Year 2007 in Australia\n\n, speak at the Australian school here in Singapore the other day. Though on the\n\nThe Southport School library webpage\n\nher job title is listed as Senior Librarian, she says she was hired ten years ago as Director of Information Services.  Instead, Director of Literacy might be appropriate.\n\nHer talk was titled:\n\nMaintaining Momentum: Keeping boys reading in the middle school years\n\n, and she gave us an overview of her philosophy and practices behind the creation of an active reading community in a day/boarding boys' school with an enrolment of approximately 1400 preschool to year 12.\n\nShe swears by\n\nStephen Krashen\n\n's\n\nThe Power of Reading\n\n,\n\nAidan Chambers\n\n's\n\nThe Reading Environment\n\n,\n\nYoung Australians Reading\n\n, and\n\nKnowing Readers\n\nby Susan LaMarca and Pam MacIntyre.\n\nThe key is getting the whole community involved\n\n-- a giant partnership -- which means not just the library and the English department, but all staff (even the cleaners) and the parents.   The goal is an environment which legitimizes wide and comprehensive reading.\n\nSome elements of her successful program:\n\n* All students keep\n\nReading Records\n\n-- lists of the books they've read in and out of school -- that follow them throughout their time at the school (so any teacher can see any student's reading history);\n\n*\n\nBook reports are 40-second oral events\n\n, done at the end of term -- no long boring writing about what you've read;\n\n*\n\nBook chat time\n\n-- lots of it -- in classrooms, in the library, in the hallways;\n\n*\n\nAuthor visits\n\n-- as many as possible;\n\n*\n\nRegular silent reading\n\ntimes throughout the school, e.g., every English class starts with 10 minutes of silent reading, and Grades 8-10 English classes come to the library every fortnight for a session of book talk and reading;\n\n*\n\nMonthly book club\n\n(and newsletter), where students get the pick of new library books to read and review;  she also takes club members out to literary festivals and any events related to books;\n\n* Ongoing\n\ncollection of data\n\n-- such as surveys to find out what the kids are reading and how they think reading helps them; this data is shared with teachers, admin, and parents;\n\n* Tons of\n\nbook displays\n\n, e.g., the first display of the year is of books which the students voted  as their favorites the year before;\n\n*\n\n7-week parent program\n\nat the beginning of each year -- in which she teaches parents the same information literacy skills the kids learn;\n\n*\n\nBig book collection\n\n, catering for all reading levels and a wide variety of interests;  she said she buys for everyone (including parents); I like her attitude that she's about choice, not censorship -- she says it's not her job to censor what a child reads -- parents can do that by submitting a form;\n\n* Supporting\n\nteachers as readers\n\nand getting them to advertise their reading to students, e.g., before every holiday break, she takes a stack of books into the staff room and passes them out, and teachers in all subject areas are encouraged to produce bookmarks of their recent reads and have them available in their classrooms for students to take;\n\n*\n\nReader's Cup\n\n(an annual competition in Australia) -- she always get a team to enter;\n\n*\n\nWriting competitions\n\n-- she encourages students to enter any online writing competition and says some students have won money from them.\n\nThree websites she recommends:\n\nThe Children's Book Council of Australia\n\nInside a Dog\n\n-- a website dedicated to books for young adults\n\nThe Source\n\n-- a (subscription) database of children's literature, especially Australian, and connected to the children's literature journal,\n\nMagpies\n\nGiven my current situation, I was particularly pleased to hear her say, of course, she lets parents borrow.  And her response to my query about borrowing limits was, unlimited!  (She did admit there are borrowing limits printed in some library policy document, but they are not enforced.)  Letters about overdue books are sent to parents after two months and any financial reckoning about lost books is only done at the end of term.  So reasonable...\n\nI also noted her comment that circular tables in the library encourage social booktalking.  Made me decide I must get to IKEA to replace a few of my dreary institutional rectangles with round colorful ones.",

For instance, on my Grade 3 wiki, there's a page for the current unit of study,\n\nBlue Planet\n\n, which is about water -- where I have a link to my collection of bookmarks.   The distinction between links for students and links for teachers/parents is based on the tags I've assigned.  When I find a relevant website, I make \"water\" one of the tags and if it's particularly good for the students, I make \"blueplanet\" a tag.  That way I can show the kids the \"\n\nblueplanet\n\n\" links and the teachers the more complete list tagged \"\n\nwater\n\n\".\n\nTag clouds shows the concentration of subjects -- and I've got two bundles of tags on my TheLibrarianEdge account:  Social Software and GreenWorld.\n\nDefinitely bother to install the buttons to make saving a link just a click away.\n\nHow it gets social is via the network feature.

The power of the social comes from seeing how others make use of tools.  So we're hoping\n\nour chart\n\nwill get filled in with examples from our participants.\n\nWhat is the best way to share information?\n\nSHARING LISTS OF BOOKS: Example 1:\n\nPYP Resources\n\nPYP teacher-librarians are always being asked to provide a book that exemplifies the\n\nIB Learner Profile\n\n.  And paper lists of relevant books are always being passed around.  My solution to this was\n\nLibraryThing\n\n, an online cataloguing program.\n\nMy catalog --\n\nUWC_PYP\n\n(see\n\ndescription\n\n)\n\nstarted out as a means of consolidating lists of books that relate to\n\nthe IB Learner Profile\n\n(examples of how we can be\n\nInquirers\n\n,\n\nThinkers\n\n,\n\nCommunicators\n\n,\n\nRisk-takers\n\n,\n\nKnowledgeable\n\n,\n\nPrincipled\n\n,\n\nCaring\n\n,\n\nOpen-minded\n\n,\n\nBalanced\n\n, and\n\nReflective\n\n), however, it's now all-purpose.\n\nFor example, my children's literature discussion group recently focused on books featuring contemporary cultures.  So I took the various recommendations and information collected them under the tag \"contemporary cultures\" in my UWC_PYP catalog.  Voila! --\n\nan instant \"contemporary cultures\" reading list\n\n.\n\nAs the school librarian, I also have been frustrated with finding out (and keeping track) of the sets of novels available (but not easily accessible) in all the grade levels' reading cupboards.  I run an after-school book club so always need new sets of novels.  Once I got the teachers to give me their paper lists, I quickly entered them in a LibraryThing catalog:\n\nUWC_novelsets\n\n.\n\nNote how the tags\n\ntell me where the books are and how many are available (where '?' indicates I'm still not sure!).",

      "content": "Another video that spiraled round the web (and got so much media attention that the guy has been offered a book contract - to write in these last months before he dies of cancer)  is\n\nProf. Randy Pausch's Last Lecture: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams\n\n, given at Carnegie Mellon back in September.  Well worth it.   (The\n\nWikipedia page on Randy\n\nhas links to everything -- e.g., listen/read his lecture on Time Management -- sure to make you feel like a sluggard...)\n\nRandy reminds us what the brick walls of life\n\nare there for.\n\nThe brick walls are not there to keep us out.  The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.  Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough.  They're there to stop\n\nother\n\npeople.\n\nOn the last day of school I hit a brick wall of sorts -- and what do librarians do when they're feeling low?  They go to a library.  Nothing like a new book, a new outlook, to perk you up.  There I picked up two books, in that serendipitous way, which were particularly apt.\n\nOne was\n\nThe Dip: a little book that teaches you when to quit (and when to stick)\n\n(2007) by\n\nSeth Godin\n\n, marketing guru, author and\n\nblogger\n\n(see/hear also his recent\n\nTED talk\n\n).\n\nGodin goes on about why it's best to be number one in whatever niche you find yourself, in this world of a million micromarkets -- to focus on the \"short head\" rather than the \"long tail\".  That's it's not good enough any more to be well rounded -- you need to persevere and get beyond the Dip, the slump between starting and mastery, between \"the artificial screens set up to keep people like you out\" [Randy's brick wall] -- because the Dip creates scarcity which creates value.  Beat Mediocrity! is his mantra.\n\nThe other book --\n\nAvoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science\n\n(2007) -- by\n\nJames Watson\n\n, of DNA \"double helix\" fame -- also talks, in the context of academic politics, about the need to be the best.  He laments how for years Harvard, where he was teaching, refused to hire other biologists working at the cutting edge, leaving rival institutions like MIT to scoop up the best geneticists.  The reason?  Harvard was complacent about already being the best.  \"Academic institutions do not easily change themselves\" is one (not very surprising) lesson he shares.\n\nBack to my world now.... How can we claim to be offering a world-class education if we don't have world-class libraries and information literacy programs?  They think our test results are doing just fine, that such things are luxuries.  As if results are the only yardstick...\n\nOur stats certainly don't measure up to a top school -- judging by the recently published\n\nSchool Libraries Count! A National Survey of School Library Media Programs 2007\n\n(American Library Association), e.g., in terms of number of qualified teacher-librarians per student, size of the collection per student, spending per student, etc.  (The Australian school/library associations are\n\nin the process of doing their own survey\n\n-- and I look forward to seeing their numbers.)\n\nBut, then, I must remember \"culture codes\" (again, see\n\nThe Culture Code\n\n(2006)  by\n\nClotaire Rapaille\n\n) come into play.  What is the code for \"school library\" in different cultures? and how does that affect the position of libraries in international schools?\n\nWe are a British heritage school and the UK simply does not have a strong tradition of school librarianship.   According to\n\na CILIP survey\n\n, less than 30% of secondary schools in England are run by qualified librarians, either full or part-time.  How many of those qualified librarians are also qualified teachers isn't mentioned (very few, I suspect) -- as school librarians are not expected to be teachers in the UK -- unlike in the US, Australia, NZ, and Canada.\n\nSo there is only a limited code for \"school librarian\" in the UK and no cultural code for \"teacher-librarian\" (or \"school library media specialist\", as they're called in the US).  It reminds me of\n\nClotaire Rapaille's story\n\nof how Nestle came to him for advice when they were having trouble selling instant coffee in Japan -- and he told them there was no cultural code for coffee there, then recommended they establish one by marketing coffee-flavored desserts to children and wait for the kids to grow up.\n\nI need to find a way for my administrators to experience the value added by a secondary school teacher-librarian and a dynamic secondary school library program... to establish a code...",

Her illustration of a culture driven by stuff allows her to isolate the moment in history where she says the trend of consumption mania began.

Her delivery is dramatic, poetic, and funny. (I've already suggested her as a speaker for\n\na TED conference\n\n.)\n\nHer emphasis on the importance of the face-to-face interaction between teachers and students reminds me of one of my favorite poems --\n\n\"Did I Miss Anything\" by Tom Wayland\n\n-- subtitled, \"Question frequently asked by students after missing a class\".\n\nEdson\n\nspoke at Commencement Day at\n\nSmith College\n\nthis past May -- her alma mater, and mine, which is how I came across her speech -- in one of those usually boring email bulletins.

Edson claims she wrote her Smith college application essay on the theme, via Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Montaigne.  I've always preferred Cavafy's expression of it in the poem \"\n\nIthaka\n\n\".\n\nEdson is passionate about her job\n\nas a kindergarten teacher and considers giving children the power to read as the best way she can change the world.\n\n\"Reading and writing is power--the thing that gives you the most power in your whole life.

As IT director, his take is the big picture and I appreciate we've come a long way, however, I still chafe at StudyWiz and its inability to let people roam around and see what other teachers are doing.  It's structure is basically silos, or, what happens in your classroom stays in your classroom.  It may suit secondary, but not primary.  Though we at the East Campus are trying to find ways to be as open as possible, using the StudyWiz junior interface.\n\nRoaming around the Learning 2.0 conference ning,  \"21st Century\" jumps out as a major buzzword.

(NB: it runs for about an hour, so get a glass of wine or a cappuccino in hand before you start.)\n\nWesch keeps asking, how can we create students who create meaningful connections?  How do we create significance?\n\nHe offers this wonderful quote from Barbara Harrell Carson (1996,\n\nThirty Years of Stories\n\n):\n\nStudents learn what they care about from people they care about and who, they know, care about them.\n\nHe discusses first finding a grand narrative to provide context and relevance (i.e., semantic meaning, or a big picture), then creating a learning environment that values and leverages the learners themselves (i.e., personal meaning) -- doing both in a way that realizes and leverages the existing media environment.  He asks, how do we move students from being knowledgeable to being knowledge-able?\n\nWesch uses\n\nNetvibes\n\nto provide a platform for student participation:\n\nMediated Cultures: Digital Ethnography at Kansas State University\n\nOn a much smaller scale, for much younger students, Keri-Lee and I are playing around with\n\nPageflakes\n\nto create\n\na portal for our primary school students\n\n.

Meanwhile, another child had got hold of the interactive whiteboard pen and was experimenting with whatever had been left up on the screen.  Three or four students clustered around, shouting out suggestions of what to press and what to try.

When she later goes back to re-read that first novel, she finds it quite easy and interesting.\n\nAnd it occurred to her (as next day she wrote down) that reading was, among other things, a muscle and one that she had seemingly developed.\n\nThis is the point of my favorite non-fiction literacy book of 2008.\n\nProust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain\n\nrepresents a snapshot — to be precise, three snapshots — of what we now know about the origins of reading (how the human brain learned how to read); the development of reading (from infancy's influence, to expert reading adults); the gifts and the challenges of reading failure in dyslexia (what happens when the brain can't read). It's a triptych of our knowledge and a frank apologia to this cultural invention that changed our lives as a species and as individual learners.\n\n...\n\nI use Proust as a metaphor for the most important aspect of reading: the ability to think\n\nbeyond\n\nwhat we read.  The great French novelist Marcel Proust wrote a little-known, essay-length book simply called\n\nOn Reading\n\nin which he wrote:\n\nThe heart of the expert reading brain is to think beyond the decoded words to construct thoughts and insights never before held by that person. In so doing, we are forever changed by what we read.\n\n--\n\nMaryanne Wolf\n\nsummarizing her own book.  (See also\n\npodcast interviews\n\nwith her.)\n\nThe acme of the reading brain is time to think.  So simple, so powerful.\n\nA system that has become streamlined through specialization and automaticity has more time to think.  This is the miraculous gift of the reading brain.\n\nTime to laugh, time to hear the author's voice, time to listen to the voice in your own head.\n\nAs Wolf points out, the evolution of writing provided a cognitive platform for other skills.\n\nIt is not reading directly that caused all these skills to flourish, but the secret gift of time to think that lies at the core of the reading brain's design was an unprecedented impetus for their growth.\n\nShe touches a bit on the implications of online reading and changes to come, but not enough.  It's a hot topic.\n\nIn July 2008 the New York Times published the first in a series of articles looking at\n\nhow the Internet and other technological and social forces are changing the way people read.  See\n\nLiteracy Debate: Online, R U Really Reading?\n\nTo accompany it, they also set up a\n\nWeb Extra: Further Reading about Reading\n\n, with links to other interesting articles, such as Slate magazine's\n\nLazy Eyes: How We Read Online\n\n(June 2008) and The Atlantic Monthly article in the July/August issue,\n\nIs Google Making Us Stupid?: What the internet is doing to our brains\n\n.\n\nMore recently, the Chronicle of Higher Education weighed in with\n\nOnline Literacy is a Lesser Kind: Slow reading counterbalances Web skimming\n\n, which argues that\n\n\"we must recognize that screen scanning is but one kind of reading, a lesser one, and that it conspires against certain intellectual habits requisite to liberal-arts learning.\"",

Any paperbacks I buy are being left as is.  No sticky-back plastic -- of any kind.\n\nIt's a decision of cost -- of the plastic, of the labor spent attaching the plastic, and to the environment which must live with the plastic for its lifetime.\n\nA similar question every school/teacher must face is,\n\nto laminate? or not to laminate?\n\nMy friend Pam Duncan, a head librarian in control of the school's laminating machine, has single-handedly managed to significantly reduce her school's plastic footprint by insisting staff justify each and every act of lamination to her personally.\n\n-- Poster by\n\nJohn Blyberg\n\n(CC-Attribution); hat-tip\n\nMichael Stephens\n\nand then\n\nLibraryThing\n\n;\n\nFYI: created using\n\nDespair, Inc\n\n.'s\n\nParody Motivator Generator\n\nDoes plastic convey authority?

      "title": "Common Genius and Creativity",
      "content": "I've been reading and digesting several thinkers/texts/thoughts on creativity -- and the genius of the cultural commons.\n\n(Image credit:\n\nlightbulbs by andydoro\n\n)\n\nThe individual genius is definitely a discredited idea these days.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell addresses this issue in his May 2008 article,\n\n\"In the Air: who says big ideas are rare?\"\n\n-- where he uses the example of\n\nNathan Myhrvold\n\nand his attempt to create a group capable of generating insights that might lead to scientific inventions and innovation.  Gladwell asserts that \"the genius is not a unique source of insight; he is merely an efficient source of insight.\"\n\nGladwell's latest book,\n\n\"Outliers: the story of success\"\n\n, similarly argues that those people who achieve extreme success owe a great deal to the fortuitous ecology of their lives.  \"They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy.\" And the success of late bloomers, like Cezanne, is highly contingent on the efforts of others surrounding and supporting them (he says in a New Yorker article on October 20, 2008,\n\n\"Late Bloomers: why do we equate genius with precocity?\"\n\n).\n\n\"For Innovators, There is Brainpower in Numbers\"\n\nran a recent article in the New York Times, affirming that \"truly productive invention requires the meeting of minds from myriad perspectives, even if the innovators themselves don't always realize it.\"  The article interestingly argues that brainstorming (or \"idea showers\" as some teachers I know prefer to call it -- eliminating that negative imagery), introduced in 1948, has been proved to be less effective than generally believed.  Evidently, \"individuals working alone generate more ideas than groups acting in concert\".  Instead, \"systematic inventive thinking\" is better, where successful products are analyzed into separate components and considered for alternative uses.  \"The best innovations occur when you have networks of people with diverse backgrounds gathering around a problem.\"\n\nClay Shirky\n\n, professor of new media at New York University and author of\n\n\"Here Comes Everybody: the power of organizing without organizations\"\n\n, argues the same thing, especially in regards to the internet and Web n.0.  (See\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n\nfor videos of him presenting the ideas of the book.) He refers to the two kinds of social capital --\n\nbonding capital\n\n, best envisaged as the number of people willing to lend you a large sum of money without asking when you'll be paying it back, and\n\nbridging capital\n\n, the number of people to whom you would lend small amounts of money without much fuss.  (In other words, bonding capital is more exclusive, bridging capital is more inclusive.)\n\nShirky asserts it's not how many people you know, it's how many different kinds of people -- that most good ideas come from people who are bridging \"structural holes\" in an institution -- because too much bonding capital in a group results in an echo-chamber of ideas.  This is not creativity born of deep intellectual ability -- it's creativity as an import-export business.\n\nAside re school librarians:  we are particularly well-suited to bring bridging capital (read: new ideas) to planning meetings, interacting as we do with all grade levels.\n\nGladwell, in an interview, also credits his own writing success with the breadth and diversity of his friendship base, when asked where he gets his ideas:\n\nPeople tell me things. I have learned, I suppose, how to position myself to have access to serendipitous moments. I fill my life with people from diverse backgrounds. I have friends in academia, in business, in technology. Once you understand the importance of those contacts you can take steps to increase the likelihood of having them pay off. I never come up with things entirely by myself. It's always in combination with somebody. I exploit the entire resources of my friends very efficiently.\n\nCharles Leadbeater\n\n, a UK consultant on innovation and creativity, came out with a book similar to Shirky's at roughly the same time --\n\nWe-Think: mass innovation, not mass production\n\n.  Videos of him speaking about the book can be found\n\nhere\n\n-- and there is a 3-minute animated illustration of the book on his\n\nhomepage\n\n.  (I must admit, I like his plain confession,\n\nThis is Not a Blog\n\n.)\n\nLeadbeater brings up\n\nLewis Hyde\n\n, poet, essayist, and author of\n\n\"The Gift\"\n\n, a book (first published in 1983) dedicated to exploring the gift economy, especially with regard to the arts, though also including the internet -- and the power of sharing and becoming aware of the gifts cycling throughout society.  Hyde was recently the focus of a New York Times Magazine article --\n\n\"What is Art For?\"\n\n-- in which he distinguishes his take on the artistic commons as more academic, abstract, and aesthetically nuanced compared with that of\n\nLawrence Lessig\n\n, founder and guru of the (more legalistic)\n\nCreative Commons\n\nmovement.  (See Lessig's brilliant TED talk on\n\nHow Creativity is being Strangled by the Law\n\n.)\n\nHyde's book explores the concept of the gift economy (contrasted to the market/commodity economy), roaming through anthropology, mythology, and poetry (Walt Whitman and Ezra Pound, in particular) -- and likens it to our current understanding of ecology -- that every gift calls for a return gift in a large self-regulating earth system.  He notes the traditional types of gifts -- separation gifts, threshold gifts or gifts of passage (birthdays, graduation, marriage, newcomers),  and incorporation gifts (goodbye presents meant to give a piece of yourself to someone going away).  Transformative gifts are less concrete, but no less important, and cover the situation of a young artist awakened to their life's labor by another's artistic gift to the world, with the paradox of the gift exchange -- that when a gift is used, it is not used up -- and how the only gratitude required is the act of passing the gift along.  (I could go on and on -- read the book -- it's available from the\n\nNational Library\n\nfor those of you in Singapore.)\n\nSpeaking of gifts -- look at this mindmap someone (\n\nAustin Kleon\n\n) has put up on Flickr re Hyde's book:\n\nIt is obvious how this all relates to Web n.0.  Here, for example, is a snippet about sharing from\n\na blog posting\n\nby\n\nMark Pesce\n\n, an Australian future-oriented consultant:\n\nThe center of this argument is simple, though subtle: the more something is shared, the more valuable it becomes. You extend your brand with every resource you share. You extend the knowledge of your institution throughout the Internet. Whatever you have – if it’s good enough – will bring people to your front door, first virtually, then physically.\n\nSpeaking of giving things away,\n\nSeth Godin\n\n, major marketing guru, is giving away his most recent book, \"Tribes\" --\n\nas an audio book\n\n.  (I listened to it while doing housework one Sunday -- a perfect way to enhance menial tasks.)\n\nHis little book is about leaders -- and how tribes (the small units we're going to find ourselves belonging to) need them -- for the 7 C's:  challenge, creating a culture, curiosity, communication, charisma, connection, and commitment.   He defines leadership as the art of giving people a platform for spreading ideas that work.  That leaders give people stories they can tell about themselves -- and that you can't lead without imagination (read: creativity).\n\nInteresting aside:  there's\n\na new social anthropology book out by Daniel Miller\n\nwhich argues that in London now every household is, in effect, a tribe.\n\nAnother free download (pass that gift on) to note:\n\nLittle Brother -- a popular young adult novel\n\nby\n\nCory Doctorow\n\nof\n\nBoing Boing\n\nfame.  Re the creativity of young people in evading Big Brother's attempt to control them and the internet.\n\nBack to creativity:  I must, of course, mention a few other TED talks on the subject:  Sir Ken Robinson -- if people know any TED talk, it's usually this one:\n\nDo Schools Kill Creativity?\n\nSee also\n\nAmy Tan\n\n-- and\n\nTim Brown\n\n.\n\nI'm going to end with\n\nAlison Gopnik\n\n, psychology/philosophy professor and child development expert and her musings on why fiction is so attractive to children (oops, humans) in the 2006\n\nEdge\n\n\"World Question Center\".\n\nThe greatest success of cognitive science has been our account of the visual system. There's a world out there sending information to our eyes, and our brains are beautifully designed to recover the nature of that world from that information. I've always thought that science, and children's learning, worked the same way. Fundamental capacities for causal inference and learning let scientists, and children, get an accurate picture of the world around them - a theory. Cognition was the way we got the world into our minds.\n\nBut fiction doesn't fit that picture - its easy to see why we want the truth but why do we work so hard telling lies? I thought that kids' pretend play, and grown-up fiction, must be a sort of spandrel, a side-effect of some other more functional ability....\n\nSo the anomaly of pretend play has been bugging me all this time. But finally, trying to figure it out has made me change my mind about the very nature of cognition itself.\n\nI still think that we're designed to find out about the world, but that's not our most important gift.\n\nFor human beings the really important evolutionary advantage is our ability to create new worlds....\n\nIn fact, I think now that the two abilities - finding the truth about the world and creating new worlds-are two sides of the same coins. Theories, in science or childhood, don't just tell us what's true - they tell us what's possible, and they tell us how to get to those possibilities from where we are now.\n\nWhen children learn and when they pretend they use their knowledge of the world to create new possibilities. So do we whether we are doing science or writing novels. I don't think anymore that Science and Fiction are just both Good Things that complement each other. I think they are, quite literally, the same thing.",

      "content": "Just found some notes on an essay of\n\nLewis Hyde\n\n-- \"Two Accidents: Reflection on Chance and Creativity\" (1998).\n\n\"The agile mind is pleased to find what it was not looking for.\"\n\n\"Wandering is the trick, and giving up on 'loss' or 'gain', and then agility of mind.\"\n\nDumb luck = luck of chance\n\nSmart luck = craft added to accident, i.e, \"a kind of responsive intelligence invoked by whatever happens\"\n\nLouis Pasteur quote: \"chance favors the prepared mind\", i.e., a mind prepared for what it isn't prepared for...\n\nChogyam Trungpa quote:  \"magic is the total appreciation of chance\"\n\ncreation (absolute newness) vs. revelation (accident as a tool of revelation)\n\nAbsolute newness = \"in a civilization as complex and shifting as ours has become, a readiness to let the mind change as contingency demands may be one prerequisite of a happy life.\"\n\nAlso just read an essay on mathematics and creativity --\n\nA Mathematician's Lament\n\n-- by Paul Lockhart -- a damning critique of the typical teaching of mathematics -- devoid of the recognition of its inherent creativity.  I want every teacher who teaches mathematics to read this and justify their current practices to me (says the indignant librarian).\n\nEverything he says rings true to me because I had a teacher like Paul Lockhart from 7th grade onwards in my little town in Maine.  Thank god for Wally Hayes and Ralph (Danny) Small.  They made mathematics come alive -- and made us exercise our mental creativity every day in the name of mathematics.  It was pure theater at times -- how Mr. Small would enthuse over a new proof he'd thought up the night before.  We believed him when he said he had the quadratic formula framed over his bedstead.  We never doubted that he spent his evenings reading mathematics books, enhanced by a bowl of potato chips and a glass of milk.\n\nHe never used labels for what he showed us -- he just showed us his thinking and encouraged us to show him ours.  I went off to college/university believing I'd never had calculus, because that word had never come up.  So I ended up repeating almost a whole year, not really knowing where Mr. Small had left off.  But I definitely recognized that what my college professor had to offer was lesser stuff -- it was all just \"cookbook\" mathematics, whereas I had been trained to do the real thing -- proofs and analysis and an underlying understanding all along, no matter whether I knew what the outside world called it or not.\n\nIn reading\n\nMalcolm Gladwell's \"Outliers\"\n\n-- and the luck of Bill Gates to have access to a computer in junior high in Washington state in 1967 or whenever it was -- I can't help but realize that I also was lucky.  It was 1972 when I was a freshman in high school that I got to program for the first time.  We had a time-share set-up with some computer in Portland and all of us had to write a computer program to solve the quadratic formula.  That meant creating an oiled punched-out tape that got fed into the remote reader and loaded into memory.  So at 15 I began my relationship with computers (okay, nowhere near the 10,000 deliberate practice hours of a Gates, but..).  Maybe it isn't so surprising that in 1980 I ended up in Boston at a software development company, despite my major in Russian Civilization. (I always used to say, languages are languages -- whether natural or mechanical.)\n\nAnyway, here's Paul Lockhart in full force on how math should be considered in the curriculum:\n\n\"The first thing to understand is that mathematics is an art.  The difference between math and the other arts, such as music and painting, is that our culture does not recognize it as such.\"\n\n\"A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns.  If his patterns are more permanet than theirs, it is because they are made with\n\nideas\n\n.\"  [G.H. Hardy]\n\n\"Mathematicians enjoy thinking about the simplest possible things, and the simplest possible things are imaginary.\"\n\n\"Mathematics is the art of explanation.  If you deny students the opportunity to engage in this activity.... you deny them mathematics itself.\"\n\n\"Math is not about following directions, it's about making new directions.\"\n\n\"A piece of mathematics is like a poem, and we can ask if it satisfies our aesthetic criteria:  Is this argument sound?  Does it make sense?   Is it simple and elegant?  Does it get me closer to the heart of the matter?\"\n\n\"Mathematics is the music of reason.\"\n\n\"The trouble is that math, like painting or poetry, is\n\nhard creative work\n\n.  That makes it very difficult to teach.  Mathematics is a slow, contemplative process.  It takes time to produce a work of art, and it takes a skilled teacher to recognize one.\"\n\n\"Teaching is not about information.  It's about having an honest intellectual relationshiop with your students.\"\n\n\"How ironic that people dismiss mathematics as the antithesis of creativity.  They are missing out on an art form older than any book, more profound than any poem, and more abstract that any abstract.\"\n\nImage credit:\n\ngadl via flickr",

      "content": "photo:\n\nMaggie Appleton\n\nRobert McKee\n\n, in his book\n\nStory: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting\n\n, presents\n\ncuriosity as the intellectual need to answer questions and close patterns\n\n-- a universal desire which story plays to by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.\n\nOlivia Judson, scientist and New York Times blogger\n\n, sees curiosity as the defining characteristic of the best scientists and as something that must be caught, not taught:\n\nIn schools, science is often taught as a body of knowledge — a set of facts and equations. But all that is just a consequence of scientific activity.\n\nScience itself is something else, something both more profound and less tangible. It is an attitude, a stance towards measuring, evaluating and describing the world that is based on skepticism, investigation and evidence.\n\nThe hallmark is curiosity; the aim, to see the world as it is.\n\nThis is not an attitude restricted to scientists, but it is, I think, more common among them. And it is not something taught so much as acquired during a training in research or by keeping company with scientists.\n\nRyszard Kapuscinski\n\n, the Polish journalist and author who died a couple of years ago, argues for this same centrality of curiosity for historians and journalists (who are really just current historians) -- exemplified by Herodotus.\n\nKapuscinski kept company with him by carrying around a copy of Herodotus's\n\nHistory\n\nthroughout his years as a foreign correspondent, and he describes the influence Herodotus had on him in his 2004 book,\n\nTravels with Herodotus\n\n(which I highly recommend as an introduction to either Kapuscinski or Herodotus).\n\nHere are snippets from the book:\n\nIn Herodotus's days, the Greek word \"history\" meant something more like \"investigation\" or \"inquiry\"\n\n.... [Herodotus] strove to find out, learn, and portray how history comes into being every day, how people create it, why its course oftens runs contrary to their efforts and expectations.\n\n[p. 257]\n\nWhat set him in motion?  Made him act? ....\n\nI think that it was simply curiosity about the world.  The desire to be there, to see it at any cost, to experience it no matter what.  It is actually a seldom encountered passion.\n\n[p. 258]\n\nTo be a conduit is their passion: therein lies their life mission.  To walk, ride, find out -- and proclaim it at once to the world.  There aren't many enthusiasts born.\n\nThe average person is not especially curious about the world..\n\n.. So when someone like Herodotus comes along -- a man possessed by a craving, a bug, a mania for knowledge, and endowed, furthermore, with intellect and powers of written expression -- it's not so surprising his rare existence should outlive him.\n\n[p. 267]\n\nSeth Godin\n\n, the business/marketing guru, has\n\na short video on the importance of being curious\n\n-- a desire to understand, a desire to try, a desire to push the envelope.  He also believes the curious are a minority and laments that the educational system does not (cannot?) promote it.\n\nCan curiosity be described as having an agile mind?\n\n(like Cliff Stoll in his\n\nTED talk \"18 Minutes with an Agile Mind\"\n\n)\n\nIs curiosity the skill of being interested in the world?\n\nRandy Nelson, dean of\n\nPixar\n\nUniversity, in\n\na short video on learning and working in the collaboration age\n\n(which is definitely worth watching), talks about Pixar looking for employees with four attributes:  1. Depth, 2. Breadth, 3. Communication, 4. Collaboration.\n\nNumber 2:  \"Breadth\" relates to being a curious person, though Nelson defines it as the skill of being interested.  He argues it's easy to find people who are interesting, but tough to find those who are more interested than interesting.  These are the people you want to talk to, he says, not because they're clever, but because they amplify \"me\", they want to know what I know -- they lean in when I talk and ask me questions.\n\nPixar is one of the companies highlighted in the book\n\nMavericks at Work: Why the Most Original Minds in Business Win\n\n-- by William C. Taylor & Polly LaBarre (2006).\n\nNelson is quoted there on the same subject:\n\n\"We've made the leap from an idea-centered business to a people-centered business.  Instead of developing ideas, we're developing people.  We're trying to create a culture of learning, filled with life-long learners.  It's no trick for talented people to be interesting, but it's a gift to be interested.  We want an organization filled with interested people.\"\n\n[p. 230]\n\nIsn't that what we all want?",

Here are my notes on\n\nan interview filmed with him in 2007\n\n.\n\nHis job is to \"oxygenate\" the New York Public Library -- to make the famous lions outside \"roar\" -- to create a library without walls.\n\nWe need to make people think it's sexy to think -- that there should be both information and inspiration.   We have to free the books.  To have a thought is to caress our brains.  Thinking is exciting!\n\nInspiration comes mainly from arguments around the kitchen table.  We need each other desperately as humans (e.g., you can't tickle yourself).  A library is a space of conviviality -- which can help us get references in common. We all need something to talk about.\n\nCuriosity is one of the most important things we can arm ourselves with in life -- if we're not curious at 20, we'll be boring at 50.  We must inspire curiosity -- to be interested in the world -- to have interests -- something to replenish our minds.\n\nThe blog\n\nDesign*Sponge\n\nhas done a couple of videos showing how a librarian at the\n\nNew York Public Library\n\nhas inspired five different artists -- a glassblower, a letterpress printer, a maker of ceramic dishes, etc. -- with material from the library's collection, whether images in books or artifacts themselves -- maps, old postcards, prints, etc.  See the videos on the NYPL webpage:\n\nDesign by the Book\n\n.\n\nSimilarly, Jay Walker is a man who believes a library should have objects to inspire -- as well as books.  There is a 7-minute TED video of him showing off some of the treasures in his amazing private library:\n\nJay Walker: A library of human imagination\n\n-- including an Enigma machine, a flag that's been to the moon and back, and a real Sputnik satellite.\n\nWired did an article on his library not long ago --\n\nBrowse the Artifacts of Geek History in Jay Walker's Library\n\n- with plenty of photos.  Go check it out.\n\nI'm going to end with a plug for the book I think should be in every library -- as a source of inspiration:\n\nAlan Fletcher\n\n's\n\nThe Art of Looking Sideways\n\n(2001), which has been described as \"the ultimate guide to visual awareness, a magical compilation that will entertain and inspire all those who enjoy the interplay between word and image, and who relish the odd and the unexpected. \"\n\nFletcher, a famous British graphic designer, is now dead, but here's a YouTube video of him talking about his unusual book.\n\nFlickr photo credits: lion:\n\nMacRonin47\n\n; library:\n\njamesjk\n\n;\n\nJay Walker library",

I often get my share early on a Saturday morning, thanks to Skype and Beth Gourley, my friend and fellow teacher-librarian.  When our video cameras come into focus, the difference in our locations is obvious.  Beth, up in Tianjin, China, at this time of year is wearing a thick bathrobe and huddled under a duvet, while I, down in Singapore, lounge in sleeveless nightwear, cooled by a ceiling fan.\n\nThis week's treasures from Beth included an article she wrote last year for\n\nKnowledgeQuest\n\ncalled\n\n\"Inquiry -- The Road Less Travelled\"\n\n(Vol. 37, No. 1, Sept/Oct 2008) and some related photos.  Unfortunately, the article is not yet available online, but should be eventually (and you could always write\n\nBeth\n\nand ask her to send you a copy.... )\n\nIn the article she describes the\n\nInternational School of Tianjin\n\n(an\n\nIBO\n\nschool) and how the teaching team there has worked on improving inquiry in the classrooms and library, starting with a group exploration of inquiry and information literacy models.\n\nThe result was a model adapted from three major sources:\n\nthe spiral of making personal meaning and understanding from Barbara Stripling (2003), guiding questions from Jennifer Branch and Dianne Oberg (2005), and language from Kath Murdoch (2005)\n\n.  The secondary school version is shown above, and they have\n\na similar one with simplified questions for the elementary school\n\n.\n\nI especially love how teachers use the model as a framework for documenting the units of inquiry.  Here is an example from one of their Kindergarten classes (click to enlarge):\n\nWhen Kath Murdoch came and worked with their teachers last year, they did a reflective exercise on their implementation of inquiry.  Here is a partial summary of the remarks collected (also taken from the article):\n\nThey go on to create the list (below left).\n\nNothing radical there -- everyone struggling to improve their inquiry will recognize the items as common goals.  Still it's good to be reminded of them.\n\nBeth is also working on a wiki called\n\nResearch Story\n\n, based on their inquiry model (which I trust she won't mind me sharing).  Like all wikis, it's a work in progress.  But I know it's made me want to go back and re-organize my own grade-level wikis around an inquiry model.\n\nNB: The inquiry cycle image at the top was developed at the International School of Tianjin (IST) in 2007.\n\nSources for the image compilation-- as taken from\n\nthe IST Flickr page\n\n:\n\nStripling, Barbara K.\n\n2003. “Inquiry-Based Learning.” In Curriculum Connections through the Library, ed.

      "content": "Research resources\n\n-- shared and organized in easily configured widgets/modules on tabbed pages --  that's what libraries using Web 2.0 tools like\n\nLibGuides\n\n,\n\nNetvibes\n\n, and\n\nPageflakes\n\ncan offer their customers.  It's one of the quickest ways to create a library portal or home page.\n\nLibGuides\n\nis not free, but it looks like it could be worth buying.\n\nCheck out\n\nthe LibGuides Community page\n\nwhere you can browse for academic, public, and school libraries and see how they have used the product.\n\nFor example, see the library guides created by:\n\nElizabeth Abarbanel and Karen Phillips\n\nat the Brentwood School (USA);\n\nBuffy Hamilton\n\nat Creekview High School (USA);\n\nThe Burlington County (public) Library\n\n(USA).\n\nBuffy (alias\n\nThe Unquiet Librarian\n\n) recently\n\nblogged about how much she loves LibGuides\n\nand she's someone who has been exploring the best means of providing students with research guides and pathfinders for some time now -- see her wiki:\n\nResearch Pathfinders 2.0: Information Streams for Students\n\n.\n\nNetvibes\n\nis the next best option -- and it's free.  This is what I've been playing with for the past few weeks, inspired by these librarians:\n\nShanghai Rego International School\n\n-- Primary Library -- by Fiona Collins\n\nDiscovery College Library\n\n-- Dianne MacKenzie in Hong Kong\n\nMy Bloomin' Web\n\n-- by Leanne Windsor at the Tokyo International School\n\n[URL updated 27/4/09]\n\nSt. Dominic's International School Junior Library\n\n-- by Yvonne Barrett in Portugal\n\nCampus des Nations Primary Library\n\n-- by Kathy Epps at the International School of Geneva\n\nCampus des Nations PYP Programme of Inquiry\n\n--also by Kathy Epps at the International School of Geneva\n\nThe beauty of Netvibes is that anything I see on any of their pages, I can easily copy to my own by simply clicking \"Share\" on a particular widget.  And everyone has both a private page and a public page, so you can play around with customizing widgets on your private page and then move them to the public sphere.\n\nFor example, I just copied over links to kids' magazines from Fiona, links on books and reading from Leanne, more book and reading links from Yvonne, links to audio book sites from Dianne, and dictionary websites from Kathy.\n\nI like how Kathy has made a separate page for the PYP units of inquiry -- and I'll be doing that as well, but for now here's\n\nmy initial effort\n\n:\n\nPageflakes is a similar tool that I have experimented with before, but then I recently read\n\na blog posting which suggested Pageflakes might die (from lack of funding)\n\n.  So I immediately began exploring Netvibes and was thrilled to find so many good library examples out there to copy.  But then just the other day there was\n\nan ominous blog posting about Netvibes!\n\nWell, I'm not giving up on Netvibes yet.  But as a form of insurance I've also just requested a proper LibGuides demo (and formal quote).  By the way, this is the official comment on costs:\n\nThe cost of an annual license depends on the size of your institution and the number of libraries involved. We try to customize the pricing for every client, to meet their specific needs (as well to fit within their budgets!). The annual license fee ranges from $899 to $2,999 ($549 for K-12 libraries). Most libraries would fall under the lower license range.\n\nContact us\n\nwith the info about your institution (FTE or # of card holders) and we'll give you an exact quote. Chances are, you'll be pleasantly surprised - LibGuides is a great deal, any way you look at it!\n\nI haven't mentioned iGoogle personalized pages, though they're quite similar.  You can also share widgets and tabs with other people, but they're designed more for personal homepages -- where someone is logged into their Google account.  So if your students all have iGoogle pages, then you could publicize library-specific widgets for them to add to their homepages.  And if you want to explore other options, see this\n\nlist of \"start page\" tools via Delicious\n\n.\n\nSpeaking of library websites, there are two I've admired recently for their clean \"Mac\" look and layout, though only\n\nLeanne's\n\nwas made on a Mac.\n\nThe other\n\nwas created using a free tool called\n\nWeebly\n\n.\n\np.s. Check out the\n\nscreencasts/tutorials\n\nThe Big House Library has made using\n\nJing\n\n(a free screen capture/screencast tool) showing how to use their library catalog (Follett's Destiny). I plan to do the same (someday).",

      "content": "Back in early January\n\nKeri-Lee Beasley\n\n, the ICT teacher, and I started\n\nan optional Web 2.0 professional development initiative for staff\n\nat our new little campus (400 students K1 through Grade 4)- copying the very successful and widespread\n\n23 Things\n\nmovement in libraries (see\n\nthis background summary\n\nand\n\nall these Delicious bookmarks tagged \"23things\"\n\n, if you've never heard of it).\n\nOur pre-assessment was an\n\nonline survey\n\nasking about our teachers' familiarity -- either\n\nNever heard of\n\n/\n\nHave heard of\n\n/\n\nHave used\n\n/ or\n\nUse regularly\n\n-- with a wide range of \"things\" like social bookmarking, blogs, wikis, RSS, Twitter, photo sharing, screen capture tools, podcasts, avatars, Skype, Google Docs, etc. (as well as some software the school subscribes to -- like StudyWiz, Atomic Learning, United Streaming, etc.).\n\nThe results\n\nwere quite revealing, especially as we had little knowledge of the existing digital literacy of our staff, this being the first year of a start-up school.  (Note:\n\nthe results for our counterparts\n\nat the other campus were similarly interesting.)\n\nOur goal was to increase awareness of what's available online to improve teachers' personal/professional productivity and enhance their teaching.   We could only tempt people to try new things -- hopefully stretching/scaffolding them to increase their ability to take more responsibility for their own Web n.0 learning. (It would be a bit ambitious to say we were aiming for the\n\nISTE Educational Technology Standards for Teachers\n\n.)\n\nI have never liked the\n\ndigital native vs. digital immigrant\n\ndistinction, as it privileges the accident of birth -- and I don't think age is the critical factor.\n\nDigital tourists vs. digital residents\n\nwould be more appropriate.  However, as a librarian I prefer a comparison with how people become an avid reader.\n\nThe \"Magic Bullet\" theory of reading\n\nsays the right book at the right time can turn a non-reader into a lifelong reader.  Sometimes all it takes is a strong recommendation or taste of a genre to become smitten.\n\nBecoming an avid online learner is similar.  For some people it happens quite easily, while others are still waiting for the \"Magic Bullet\" -- the right tool at the right time -- in order to understand the power of the experience.  So, in selecting \"things\" (or Web 2.0 genres) for our Connecting East initiative and recommending examples to have a look at, Keri-Lee and I were hoping to expose our teachers to potential \"Magic Bullets\".\n\nA recent\n\narticle in Innovate\n\nidentifies the progression of a 21st century online learner as first\n\nto link\n\n, then\n\nto lurk\n\n, and then\n\nto lunge\n\n.  In deciding what we could -- and should -- cover in 10 assignments, Keri-Lee and I basically set out a similar path for our participants while offering four levels of differentiation:\n\nNovice\n\n/\n\nApprentice\n\n/\n\nPractitioner\n\n/\n\nExpert\n\nFor example, we began with\n\nsocial bookmarking\n\n(i.e., linking), as 44% of our target audience had never heard of sites like\n\nDelicious\n\nand\n\nDiigo\n\n.  Later we suggested\n\nblogs to read\n\n(i.e., lurking) and ways to\n\ncollect their own personal learning online\n\n(i.e., lunging).  Other assignments included more prosaic skills, like manipulating/creating images and using interactive whiteboards.  See\n\nour Connecting East wiki\n\nfor an overview.  (NB: The links in red on the wiki sidebar also show what we\n\ndidn\n\n't manage to fit in or get around to.)\n\nE-mail\n\nwas used to announce a new topic, introduced via a\n\nConnecting East\n\nblog\n\nposting, with task details described on a\n\nConnecting East\n\nwiki\n\npage -- plus weekly face-to-face time on\n\n\"Fruity Fridays\"\n\nwhere we were available before school in the joint library/ICT lab to answer questions, with breakfast fruit on offer as an incentive.\n\nIt's not over yet -- the last assignment goes out today -- a reflective exercise, of which this blog post is part.  Participants then have until early June to complete all tasks to qualify for a prize draw of an iPod, wine, or books.\n\nBut has it been worthwhile?  Yes, definitely -- at least for me and Keri-Lee.  In fact, it's been a good example of\n\nmeaningful work\n\n, which\n\nMalcolm Gladwell\n\nin\n\nOutliers\n\ndefines by the qualities of\n\nautonomy\n\n,\n\ncomplexity\n\n, and\n\na connection between effort and reward\n\n.  It's also been a case of\n\ncollaborative fun\n\n-- for which my role model is\n\nDan Ariely\n\n; I just read his book\n\nPredictably Irrational\n\nand I was struck by how many colleagues he regularly collaborates with in setting up his quirky experiments in behavioral economics.  Keri-Lee and I put just as much time and thought into setting up the Connecting East experiences for our colleagues and analyzing the results -- and had (almost) as much fun as Ariely and his friends.\n\nIf our own learning has been the greatest reward so far, it's less certain how much others have gained.  We have seen definite glimmers, but the uptake hasn't been as high as we, of course, would like.\n\nWhich reminds me of the advice:\n\nDon't water rocks...\n\nBe thankful for the teachers who did take us up on our offer and who have tried something new, whether it's starting to bookmark, to Twitter, or to play with Netvibes -- and put more energy into them.  After all, it takes time for someone to turn into an avid reader/learner.\n\nNetworked teacher image via\n\nlangwitches @ Flickr\n\nRock image via\n\njasohill @ Flickr\n\nWine image via\n\nJoe Pitz @ Flickr\n\niPod image via\n\nAndrew* @ Flickr\n\nBooks image via\n\nlibrarybug @ Flickr\n\nButterfly bullet image via\n\nrazZziel @ Flickr",

It’s what we can do with information that is changing things.\"\n\n(2008)\n\n\"... embracing tools that give all their student-learners and teacher-learners ubiquitous access to networked, digital, and abundant information — and the capacity to work that information and express discoveries and outcomes compellingly to authentic audiences.\"\n\n(2009)\n\nInformation\n\n&\n\nDigital\n\nLite\n\nracies also nicely combines the main characteristic of our respective subject areas -- me as the Teacher-Librarian and Keri-Lee as the ICT Facilitator.\n\nWhat's new this year besides recognition of us as a team?\n\nOne, Keri-Lee is no longer an ICT \"teacher\" on a release-time, weekly fixed schedule with classes; instead she's a facilitator on a flexi-schedule, collaborating with classroom teachers on different units of inquiry, as I have been.\n\nTwo, we're using the\n\nISTE\n\nNETS for Students\n\nas our roadmap and are working on a document for our teachers, translating the\n\nNETS Profiles\n\ninto\n\npossible experiences/scenarios\n\nfor our students based on our curriculum and taking the\n\nIBO PYP\n\nTransdisciplinary Skills (Communication, Research, Thinking, Self-Management, and Social) into account. In addition, we're looking at the NETS  for\n\nTeachers\n\n,\n\nAdministrators\n\n, and\n\nTechnology Facilitators\n\n.\n\nThree, we have some new technology toys, which teachers can book, just like they can book us:  a set of\n\niPod Touches\n\nand a set of\n\nvideo cameras\n\n.\n\nIn celebration of this shift, Keri-Lee and I attended the\n\n21st Century Learning @ Hong Kong: Extending Tomorrow's Leaders with Digital Learning\n\n, held September 17-19, 2009, at\n\nHong Kong International School (HKIS)\n\n.\n\nWith over 500 attendees, many of us from overseas, there was a good mix of teachers (a lot of IT/ICT, but also librarians and others) - and\n\nthe program\n\nhad plenty to offer.\n\n(NB: I presented a workshop with\n\nBeth Gourley\n\n, from the\n\nIn\n\nternational School of Tianjin\n\n, called\n\nDigital Gist\n\n:\n\nHarnessing digital content for learning and the library:\n\nan inquiry into texts online in audio, video, and e-book formats\n\n.)\n\nOne of the most useful sessions Keri-Lee and I attended, in terms of our goals for our own school, was\n\nWalking the Talk: 21st Century Learning in Curriculum Design and Learning\n\nby\n\nGreg Curtis\n\n, Curriculum Director at the\n\nInternational School of Beijing\n\n(ISB).\n\nHe started off with this video (from\n\nThe Onion\n\n) re the \"21st century skills\" our kids are going to need.\n\nGreg stressed that the 21st century movement (yes, they do use the term at ISB) is a learning one, not a technology one -- and therefore needs to be driven by the curriculum unit, not the IT department -- that it's about strategic planning and future visioning, not IT planning.  (Read: management buy-in is critical.)\n\nAt ISB they are trying to create a \"pull\" culture, rather than a \"push\" one -- to infuse technology into learning experiences and explorations, not force it.  A culture where technology is expected to be used and will be drawn in.  Never technology for its own sake.  Context is everything.  It's all about the learning -- always about the learning.\n\nHe walked us through ISB's\n\nLea\n\nrning 21\n\nframework -- with\n\nStandards\n\nin the center, then moving out a ring to the Learning 21\n\nApproaches\n\n, and then the outer ring of Learning 21\n\nSkills\n\n.  (I was pleased to learn they had blended the library and technology standards.)\n\nAll these are incorporated, along with\n\nUnderstanding by Design\n\nconstructs, into their Curriculum Mapping system, which allows them to visually check the spread of assessment tasks and see how the Learn 21 Approaches and Skills are being integrated.\n\nTo implement this program, ISB has initiated an early release afternoon on Wednesdays, providing two hours a week of concentrated staff professional development time.\n\nWhat a tremendous commitment to a program and a process.  I look forward to following ISB's progress over the next few years.\n\nSee Greg's handout\n\n- scanned and uploaded to Google Docs\n\nSee also my rough notes on his presentation\n\n- in Google Docs\n\n(By the way, I was pleased to see Sharon Vipond, the secondary librarian at HKIS, has posted\n\nher notes on all the keynote speeches\n\nfrom the conference.)\n\nIt was such a beneficial and collaborative exercise attending the conference together with Keri-Lee -- we were continually bouncing impressions and ideas off each other.  We'll see how we get on with our own integrated standards, approaches, and skills initiative -- and our efforts to infuse information and digital literacy into our East campus classrooms.\n\nAnd hats off to the conference organizers -- it was a well-executed event and I would definitely attend it again.",

      "content": "Clay\n\ndoesn't stop.   Luckily the blog entry he just wrote --\n\n“You Suck at Photoshop”: Paragon of Creative Project-Based Learning\n\n-- fits in perfectly with where I want to continue from\n\nmy last post\n\n(which was spurred by a previous post of his:\n\nBarbarians with Laptops\n\n).\n\nIt's about the importance of narrative in the teaching/learning process.\n\nOkay,\n\nYou Suck at Photoshop\n\nisn't \"a grand narrative\" (one of the three essential elements of teaching according to Michael Wesch (see my\n\nprevious post\n\n)). But the format could be used to help convey one, incorporating \"disciplinary knowledge\" into a funny story with a good hook. And Clay showed us an example of a teacher, Lynn Hunt of UCLA -- a \"sage on the stage\" -- presenting a compelling introduction to the Enlightenment -- by telling us a good story. It's \"chalk and talk\" but effective. (See his blog post:\n\nNew Tech Teaching Habits\n\n.)\n\nThe power of storytelling is often lost in the\n\nongoing debates\n\nover:\n\nteacher-centered vs. student-centered learning\n\ncontent vs. process focus\n\ntraditional vs. progressive\n\n\"sage on the stage\" vs. \"guide on the side\"\n\ndisciplinary knowledge vs. 21st century skills\n\nTwo theorists who consider storytelling at the constant heart of intelligence and teaching and learning are\n\nRoger Schank\n\nand\n\nKieran Egan\n\n. Both have been around for a long time and are still producing work, e.g., see:\n\nKieran Egan's 2009 book,\n\nThe Future of Education\n\n- as well as\n\nLearning in Depth: A simple innovation that can transform schooling\n\n, due out from the University of Chicago Press in 2010;\n\nRoger Schank's upcoming book,\n\nCognition! Teaching Kids to Think\n\n(see\n\nthe first four chapters\n\nhe's made available on his website)\n\n-- and both deserve wider audiences, if only as interesting voices from the margins to test your own ideas against.\n\nRoger Schank\n\nThe best historical introduction to\n\nRoger Schank\n\nis probably\n\nvia the Edge.org website\n\n.  You might read his article\n\n\"Information is Surprises\"\n\n(1995).  Especially note the comments by other people at the end -- re him, not that article.  I particularly like this one:\n\nW. Daniel Hillis:\n\nThe Roger Schank I knew was a thorn in everybody's side — constructively so. The interesting thing about Roger Schank, something he shares with Minsky, is the fact that he's produced an incredible string of students. Anybody who's produced such a great string of students has to be a constructive pain in the ass. He's always taken an adversarial stance in his theories. He doesn't just say, \"Here's my theory.\" He says, \"Here's why I'm right and everybody else is an idiot.\" He's often right.\n\nOkay, now that you're primed for someone quite opinionated\n\n(I like that phrase: \"a constructive pain the ass\"...)\n\n, go watch this Jan 2009 video, filmed in Barcelona where he is helping to open a new\n\nInstitute for the Learning Sciences\n\n(as part of their Business Engineering program*) -- based on a\n\nStory-Centered Curriculum\n\n.  He goes through everything wrong with existing schools and describes his ideal school:\n\nIn summary:\n\n\"Every curriculum should tell a story... and the story should be one that tells what the life of the future practitioner is like (and it should involve lots of practice).\"\n\nAs he says, teaching doesn't mean talking -- people aren't good at listening -- we listen to be entertained, not to learn. Learning happens as a result of being hooked by good stories -- and by practicing goal-based scenarios that are fun or obviously useful.\n\nHere are my notes on Roger Schank's  1999 book,\n\nTell Me a Story: Narrative and Intelligence\n\n, a thought-provoking read for teacher-librarians as it's about stories, learning, and information retrieval (out of the brain, not the internet) --and so relates to fiction, non-fiction, and tagging/cataloging.\n\n(\n\nGoogle Books\n\nmakes a lot of the book available online, as well as the foreword by the literary critic Gary Saul Morson.)\n\nTeaching is the right story at the right time.\n\nGood stories with lots of information allow listeners to derive their own conclusions.\n\nWe do not remember a whole story, but only the gist, indexed in different ways.\n\nListening is hard -- stories usually just trigger stories back and forth -- how does new learning occur?\n\nCreativity is the adaptation of old stories to new purposes -- it arises not from the void, but from the drawer. And the drawer is only full by virtue of intelligent indexing over time -- the collecting of lots of stories in the brain. Understanding is the process of index extraction -- figuring out what story to tell.\n\nFind an anomaly -- ask a question -- get a story. Anomalies are when we don't know the answer. When we have no story to tell, we look for one -- by asking ourselves questions.\n\nCuriosity is about recognizing anomalies and having the ability to take pleasure in exploring them, which leads us to the value of the search process itself and to prefer answers that lead to ever more questions.\n\nOr as Schank says on page 231:\n\n\"Learning to explain phenomena such that one continues to be fascinated by the failure of one's explanations creates a continuing cycle of thinking that is the crux of intelligence.\"\n\nRe the failure to listen to failure, see this recent Wired article  -\n\nAccept Defeat: The Neuroscience of Screwing Up\n\n. The importance of having a broad input of stories -- and a broad audience -- is highlighted:\n\nWhen Dunbar reviewed the transcripts of the meeting, he found that\n\nthe intellectual mix generated a distinct type of interaction\n\nin which\n\nthe scientists were forced to rely on metaphors and analogies to express themselves\n\n. (That’s because, unlike the\n\nE. coli\n\ngroup, the second lab lacked a specialized language that everyone could understand.) These abstractions proved essential for problem-solving, as they encouraged the scientists to reconsider their assumptions.\n\nHaving to explain the problem to someone else forced them to think, if only for a moment, like an intellectual on the margins, filled with self-skepticism\n\n.\n\n[\n\nbold\n\nadded]\n\nThis is similar to something a former PhD student said about what he learned from Schank (quoted by Schank in his\n\nfour-chapter preview\n\nof his upcoming book:\n\nYou taught me that often our theories get so complex that it takes a specialist with years of training to understand them.    When we get our theories this distant from everyday life and everyday people, it is awkward explaining what we do when in conversation with our family, friends, the press, and even upper level executives, etc.\n\nYou taught me to test to see if what you are doing matters and is of interest to the everyday person seeking distraction and some entertainment, but not entirely brain dead, with some curiosity left about life and what others think.\n\nIn other words, can you make an interesting story out of it?\n\nKieran Egan\n\nKieran Egan\n\nargues that students have access to plenty of information - the problem is getting it into them and getting it to mean anything to them.   Knowledge exists only in people, in living tissue in our bodies; what exists in libraries and computers are only codes or externally stored symbolic material.\n\nThis is where powerful stories and metaphors come in -- as tools to engage students' imagination and emotions in learning about the world.\n\nEgan insists that students' imaginations can only work with what they know, so a great deal of content knowledge is required.  He's an advocate of students becoming experts, e.g., by studying one topic throughout their whole school career (in addition to the usual curriculum). (See his new\n\nLearning in Depth\n\nproject.)\n\nStorytelling fits into Egan's larger framework of cognitive tools and theory of\n\nImaginative Education\n\n. These cognitive tools are the things that enable our brains to do cultural work -- and he likens to operating systems or programs in the brain, forms of which are running at all times in varying degrees at all ages: the\n\nSomatic\n\n(the body & its senses), the\n\nMythic\n\n(oral language), the\n\nRomantic\n\n(reading and writing), the\n\nPhilosophic\n\n(the meta-narrative of systems in the world), and the\n\nIronic\n\n(multiple perspectives in the mind at one time).\n\nFor more details on Egan's framework, see\n\nThe Educated Mind: how cognitive tools shape our understanding\n\n(1997);  for a more practical guide to his storytelling ideas for younger students, see his\n\nTeaching as Storytelling: an alternative approach to teaching and curriculum in the elementary school\n\n(1986).\n\nEgan defines education as \"the process in which we maximize the tool kit we individually take from the external storehouse of culture.\"  For me, libraries (whether physical or virtual) are primary portals to that cultural storehouse.  (As they say, knowledge is free at the library -- bring your own container.)  And librarians are there with embodied knowledge to help people find the right story at the right time.\n\nMore on Storytelling and Metaphors\n\nVivian Gussin Paley\n\nand her books are all about storytelling with young children -- and how\n\nstory and play are inextricable in the learning process\n\n(which will be the topic of my next post -- stories, serious play and disciplinary knowledge)\n\nThese next ones are NOT specifically re education and you probably know most of them, but they're some of my favorite examples of storytelling and metaphors.\n\nTED talks that exemplify a great story:\n\nSherwin Nuland on electroshock therapy\n\nand\n\nJill Bolte Taylor's stroke of insight\n\n-- and a TED talk that gives a great example of being taught how to tell a story at a young age:\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin\n\nRandy Pausch's Last Lecture: on achieving your childhood dreams\n\nPostSecret -\n\neach postcard is the tip of an iceberg of a story - (I can't help but think some were created as an exercise by a budding novelist...)\n\nThe Moth podcasts\n\n-- true stories told live on stage with no notes or props\n\nTwo connected books:\n\nExercises in Style\n\n(1947) by Raymond Queneau, and its modern counterpart:\n\n99 Ways to Tell a Story\n\n(2005) by Matt Madden\n\nTED talk: James Geary, metaphorically speaking\n\nGeorge Lakoff\n\nis the expert on metaphors as far as I'm concerned - his\n\nMetaphors We Live By\n\n(1980) (co-authored with Mark Johnson) is the place to start, but don't stop there....\n\nSpeaking of metaphors, I can't help but throw in Stephen Colbert and Sean Penn on April 19, 2007 competing in the\n\nMeta-Free-Phor-All: Shall I Nail Thee to a Summer's Day?\n\nThe Colbert Report\n\nMon - Thurs 11:30pm / 10:30c\n\nMeta-Free-Phor-All: Shall I Nail Thee to a Summer's Day?\n\nwww.colbertnation.com\n\nColbert Report Full Episodes\n\nPolitical Humor\n\nEconomy\n\nLast but not least, the metaphor I use to introduce information overload and the need for smart searching on the internet:\n\nImage via\n\nWill Lion\n\non Flickr\n\n* re business schools, there's\n\na debate in the NYTimes re the appropriate metaphor for how universities (especially business schools) treat students\n\n- as customers? as products?

      "content": "Clay Burell\n\nhas been on a writing binge over the holiday -- and there have been long conversations in the comments of several posts, which, as Clay put it, have been the equivalent of college-level credit in terms of professional development. NB: Some of my contributions are re-formatted and expanded below.\n\nFirst of all, see the original\n\nBeyond School\n\nblog posts (among others):\n\nBarbarians with Laptops: An Unreasonable Fear?\n\nOn Using Technology Without Understanding It\n\nWhy “Academic Excellence” No Longer Cuts It Today\n\nVideos: Mental Poverty, Collaboration, “Recession Skills 101″\n\nClay expressed his fear that we are producing\n\nbarbarians with laptops\n\nand challenged people to to provide good examples of learning that effectively enhanced content and the development of important skills -- and many did. (Check out the responses of Roberto Greco, Monika Hardy, Neil Stephenson,  Hellen Harding, et al.)\n\nI cited\n\nMichael Wesch's philosophy of teaching outlined in a video\n\nin 2008 as my guiding light.\n\nIn summary, to create students who make meaningful connections we need to\n\nfind a grand narrative and provide context and relevance\n\n(i.e., semantic meaning);\n\ncreate a learning environment that values and leverages learners themselves\n\n(i.e., personal meaning); and\n\ndo both in a way that realizes and leverages the existing media environment\n\nTechnology isn’t an end in itself -- it’s about leverage in the service of meaningful connections. So if it doesn't enhance the learning in the classroom and it's not authentic participation in the existing media environment (read: busywork), you shouldn't feel obliged to use it.\n\nCliff Stoll\n\nis someone who comes down squarely against computers in the classroom.  See his 1999 book,\n\nHigh-Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian\n\n-- as well as\n\nhis Feb. 2006 TED talk\n\n(which provides an excellent preview of how he would perform as a teacher in a classroom).\n\n(And if you want an example of what it means to be a ruthless and natural inquirer, read his 1989 book\n\nThe Cuckoo's Egg: tracking a spy through the maze of computer espionage\n\n.)\n\nHere he is talking about computers in classrooms -- from\n\nan interview in 2000\n\n:\n\nStoll\n\n: The one thing that computers do extraordinarily well is bring information to kids. Computers give kids access to vast amounts of information.\n\nEW\n\n: Don't computers have a place in the classroom, then, if merely as a source of information?\n\nStoll\n\n: Is a lack of information a problem in schools? I've never once had a teacher say to me \"I don't have enough information.\" Teachers say they don't have enough time. The problem in classrooms is not a lack of information. It's too much information.\n\n......\n\nStoll\n\n: ... The problem is that the use of computers subtracts from the student-to-teacher contact hours. It directs attention away from the student-teacher relationship and directs it toward the student-computer relationship. It teaches students to focus on getting information rather than on exploring and creating. Which is more interactive -- a student and a teacher or a student and a computer? ...\n\nRe the love inherent in classroom teaching and the importance of time with a teacher (technology aside), I can't help but re-recommend a commencement address by\n\nMargaret Edson, teacher and playwright\n\n.\n\nThere's a link in this blog post\n\n(skip the first 3 min of her talk and get to the heart of it).\n\nUmberto Eco in this interview\n\nalso brings up the problem of too much information, but sees the teacher (in the role of master to apprentices) as instrumental in dealing with it.\n\nEco\n\n: ... These [Google] lists can be dangerous -- not for old people like me, who have acquired their knowledge in another way, but for young people, for whom Google is a tragedy. Schools ought to teach the high art of how to be discriminating.\n\nSPIEGEL\n\n: Are you saying that teachers should instruct students on the difference between good and bad? If so, how should they do that?\n\nEco\n\n: Education should return to the way it was in the workshops of the Renaissance. There, the masters may not necessarily have been able to explain to their students why a painting was good in theoretical terms, but they did so in more practical ways. Look, this is what your finger can look like, and this is what it has to look like. Look, this is a good mixing of colors. The same approach should be used in school when dealing with the Internet. The teacher should say: \"Choose any old subject, whether it be German history or the life of ants. Search 25 different Web pages and, by comparing them, try to figure out which one has good information.\" If 10 pages describe the same thing, it can be a sign that the information printed there is correct. But it can also be a sign that some sites merely copied the others' mistakes.\n\nLast year Clay Shirky pointed out\n\nIt's Not Information Overload, It's Filter Failure\n\n.\n\nIn that light, Umberto Eco is proposing teachers as human filters** for disciplinary knowledge and practices, teaching students to discriminate.\n\nFrank Schirrmacher\n\nrecognizes this same need to question what we're consuming in the way of information.\n\nHe talks about humans as ''informavores\" in this video/transcript:\n\nEdge In Frankfurt: THE AGE OF THE INFORMAVORE— A Talk with Frank Schirrmacher\n\n.\n\nI think it's very interesting, the concept — again, Daniel Dennett and others said it — the concept of the informavores, the human being as somebody eating information. So you can, in a way, see that the Internet and that the information overload we are faced with at this very moment has a lot to do with food chains, has a lot to do with food you take or not to take, with food which has many calories and doesn't do you any good, and with food that is very healthy and is good for you. ....\n\nAs we know, information is fed by attention, so we have not enough attention, not enough food for all this information. And, as we know — this is the old Darwinian thought, the moment when Darwin started reading Malthus — when you have a conflict between a population explosion and not enough food, then Darwinian selection starts. And Darwinian systems start to change situations. And so what interests me is that we are, because we have the Internet, now entering a phase where Darwinian structures, where Darwinian dynamics, Darwinian selection, apparently attacks ideas themselves: what to remember, what not to remember, which idea is stronger, which idea is weaker.\n\nIt's the question: what is important, what is not important, what is important to know? Is this information important? Can we still decide what is important? And it starts with this absolutely normal, everyday news.\n\nHaving introduced the metaphor of information as food, I can't help but end with a link to one of the essays David Brooks gave a\n\n2009 Sidney (best essay) award\n\nto:\n\nIs Food the New Sex? - Mary Eberhardt - Hoover Institution - Policy Review\n\nTry reading it, substituting the word \"\n\ninformation\n\n\" for \"\n\nfood\n\n\" or \"\n\nsex\n\n\"....\n\nThese disciplines imposed historically on access to food and sex now raise a question that has not come up before, probably because it was not even possible to imagine it until the lifetimes of the people reading this:\n\nWhat happens when, for the first time in history — at least in theory, and at least in the advanced nations — adult human beings are more or less free to have all the sex and food they want?\n\nThis question opens the door to a real paradox. For given how closely connected the two appetites appear to be, it would be natural to expect that people would do the same kinds of things with both appetites — that they would pursue both with equal ardor when finally allowed to do so, for example, or with equal abandon for consequence; or conversely, with similar degrees of discipline in the consumption of each.\n\nIn fact, though, evidence from the advanced West suggests that nearly the  opposite seems to be true. The answer appears to be that when many people are  faced with these possibilities for the very first time, they end up doing very  different things —\n\nthings we might signal by shorthand as mindful eating, and mindless sex.\n\nThis  essay is both an exploration of that curious dynamic, and a speculation about  what is driving it.\n\n[\n\nbold\n\nadded]\n\nHere we are, for the first time in history with all the information we want.  It's the \"Informavore's Dilemma\" ***.  Now we just need to develop the discipline for\n\nmindful information consumption\n\n.\n\n** Social bookmarking is a form of  discriminating filtering and\n\nRoberto Greco, with over 17,500 bookmarks on Delicious\n\nis one of my richest human filters for reading material.  As a librarian, I'm impressed with both his descriptions and his tags.\n\n*** I thought I was being clever  vis-a-vis\n\nMichael Pollan's book \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\"\n\n, but Google tells me\n\nfindability.org\n\nused it first...\n\np.s. Wherever I've used the word \"teacher\", I obviously include \"librarians\".\n\nImage of Umberto Eco via\n\ngiveawayboy\n\non Flickr / Image of bento box via\n\nCowism\n\n/ Image of Google log via\n\nthe Telegraph UK",

      "content": "\"Building literate communities\"\n\nand  \"\n\nSupporting the digital education agenda\n\n\"\n\nwere two of the four strands of  the\n\nIASL / SLAQ (Int'l Assoc. of School Librarianship / School Library Assoc. of Queensland) 2010 conference\n\nheld in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Sep. 27 - Oct. 1.\n\nOver the course of the week the two themes merged into an essential question for me:\n\nHow to build\n\ndigitally\n\nliterate communities\n\n?\n\nOur school is embarking on a\n\n\"21st Century Teaching & Learning\" program\n\n(aka\n\niLearn\n\n) over the next two years, part of which will involve going 1:1 with Apple laptops in Grade 6 and above (and 2:1 below that) -- and designing new library/information spaces.\n\nPresentations by two academics - one an education/business/think-tank professor and the other a education/futurist -- gave me some interesting concepts and phrases to play with -- re people and spaces that will support the digitally literate community we want to become.\n\nMichael Hough\n\n, Professorial Fellow at the Univ. of Wollongong -- Keynote: \"\n\nIn Schools that Face the Future, Libraries Matter\n\n\" -- & Session: \"\n\nThe Role of the Teacher-Librarian in Developing Leadership Capabilities in Staff\n\n\"\n\nErica McWilliam\n\n, co-leader of the Creative Workforce Program at Queensland University of Technology -- Keynote:\n\n\"High Standards or a High Standard of Standardness?\"\n\n>>>\n\nSee a vodcast and accompanying slideshow for each keynote\n\n<<<\n\nBoth explored the e-learning shift underway and confirmed the need for\n\n21st Century Teacher-Librarians\n\n(see\n\nJoyce  Valenza's Manifesto for the definitive description of one\n\n), with Hough claiming librarians should become the C.I.O. (Chief Information Officer) of their schools.\n\nHe highly recommended the recently published book --\n\nDeveloping a Networked School Community\n\n-- and cited Chapter 9 (most of which you can read via\n\nGoogleBooks\n\n) by\n\nLyn Hay\n\n(who was one of my online professors -- I wrote a paper on\n\nGaming in Education\n\nfor her back in 2005...)\n\n.\n\nHough particularly liked her concept of the\n\niCentre\n\n, which she defines as\n\n\"the central facility within the school where information, technology, learning and teaching needs are supported by qualified information and learning technology specialists.  It is a centre that provides students and teachers with a one-stop shop for all resourcing, technology, and learning needs on a daily basis.\"\n\n(See also the slides from a recent keynote by Hay: \"\n\n21st  Century Teacher-Librarian: Rethink, Rebuild, and Re-brand\n\n\".)\n\nMcWilliam provided an interesting variation on the idea, by surveying the culture of the coffee house from raucous 17th century London up until erudite 20th century Vienna.  A home away from home, a place you want to go to. She argued Hogarth's coffee house was an antecedent of the lifelong learning space -- a round table of communal resources (both liquid and intellectual) -- and that librarians would benefit from considering the various skills and dispositions of those distant coffee house landlords (arbiter, assembler, gossip provider, business manager, service manager, social broker of relationships, etc) over time.\n\nShe suggested today's online model might be nings, an iCafe for shared passions. I think Twitter is a fitter descendant.\n\n#slaqiasl2010\n\nwas the Twitter tag for the conference -- and others in my personal learning network were far more adept at typing up the passing thoughts (special thanks to\n\nStacey Taylor\n\n,\n\nMarita Thomson\n\n, and\n\nJessica Jorna\n\nfor their quick minds and fingers. You allowed me to concentrate on my own more expansive note-taking.)\n\nThe whole conference was a community experience, with an overlapping of school librarians, international school librarians, IBO school librarians, and academics.\n\nIn line with the same \"building communities\" theme, Barb Philip, the junior school teacher-librarian at Tanglin Trust School here in Singapore, and I did a presentation on \"\n\nBuilding Internationally Literate Communities\n\n\", based on our library network's efforts to expand the reading experiences of our students.\n\nMore blog posts re learning and connections made at the conference to follow...",

      "content": "As part of a self-study accreditation process, our school has invited staff to consider the question of what\n\nlearning\n\nis -- for three hours on a Saturday morning.  Reps from each grade/area should be in attendance -- and each person is asked to bring along a book, article, or reference.  I know what mine will be.\n\nEngaging Minds: changing teaching in complex times\n\n-- 2nd ed, 2008 -- by Brent Davis, Dennis Sumara, and Rebecca Luce-Kapler.\n\nHere are some bits.... taken from\n\nmy notes\n\n.....\n\nLearning is about becoming attentive to things you never noticed before -- becoming conscious -- becoming aware.\n\nTeachers play a pivotal role in orientating attentions in ways that prompt transformations in personal perception and consciousness -- helping people to notice what they haven't noticed.\n\nEducation is not about compelling others to see the world in the ways we see it, but in terms of expanding the space of the possible.\n\nThe notion of shared labor -- social learning -- highlighting how complex knowing is distributed across a web of individuals.\n\nThe learner is the collective.  Knowledge cannot exist independent of the knower -- it is a potential to action both embodied and situated.  Bodies know, and that's what makes them part of grander knowing bodies.  Knowledge, then is about relationship.\n\nThe metaphor of the teacher as \"the consciousness of the collective\" -- expanding the space of the possible and \"creating conditions for the emergence of the as-yet unimagined\".\n\nPrompting change or learning is a matter of disequilibrium.... with the teacher in the middle, mediating, mentoring -- giving voice and advocating... opening up spaces for collective action, not defining the action.\n\nTeaching is not about what the teacher does, it's about what happens to the learner.\n\nLearning is complex, full of recursive elaboration... iterative processes and nested systems.\n\n\"A complexified conception of curriculum would suggest an image more like a phase space or a fractal tree, in which each event opens up new possibilities for action, which in turn open still other divergent possibilities.  There is no particular direction -- except, perhaps, toward the expansion of the space of the possible.\"\n\nA teacher is constantly perturbed and being perturbed.\n\nTeaching is an event that prompts a complex system to respond differently.\n\nThe lesson plan is a thought experiment.\n\nI'm fascinated with the idea of the unknown unknowns*.  E.g., see\n\nmy blog post on Roger Schank\n\n.  His definition of learning bears repeating:\n\n\"Learning to explain phenomena such that one continues to be fascinated by the failure of one's explanations creates a continuing cycle of thinking that is the crux of intelligence.\"\n\nPiaget said intelligence is what is called on when an agent doesn't know what to do, i.e., discerning what really matters in a situation.\n\nKarl Hostetler, a professor interested in both philosophy and education -- (download\n\na PDF of his article << What is \"Good\" Education Research?>> (2005)\n\n),  quotes Hans-Georg Gadamer (1960/1989) :\n\n\"Knowledge always means, precisely, considering opposites.  Its superiority over preconceived opinion consists in the fact that is able to conceive of possibilities as possibilities.... [So] only a person who has questions can have knowledge. [However] there is no such thing as a method of learning to ask questions, of learning to see what is questionable.  On the contrary, the example of Socrates teaches that\n\nthe important thing is the knowledge that one does not know\n\n.\"\n\nThis potential knowledge is what we as teachers must value -- in ourselves as much as in our students.\n\nErrol Morris, the documentary filmmaker, did a 5-part series of articles on knowing and unknowing in the NYT earlier this year --\n\n\"The Anosognosic's Dilemma:  Something's Wrong but You'll Never Know What It Is\" (Part I)\n\n-- in which he interviews David Dunning, a professor who is known for his elaboration of the\n\nDunning-Kruger effect\n\n, which is when our incompetence masks our ability to recognize our incompetence.\n\nDunning:\n\n\"Unknown unknown solutions haunt the mediocre without their knowledge. The average detective does not realize the clues he or she neglects.  The mediocre doctor is not aware of the diagnostic possibilities or treatments never considered.  The run-of-the-mill lawyer fails to recognize the winning legal argument that is out there.  People fail to reach their potential as professionals, lovers, parents and people simply because they are not aware of the possible.  This is one of the reasons I often urge my student advisees to find out who the smart professors are, and to get themselves in front of those professors so they can see what smart looks like.\"\n\nWhen I read that, I realized why I love\n\nTED Talks\n\nso much -- it gives me easy access to seeing what smart looks like.  It also gives another angle on the role of the teacher.  People like to say 21st century learning demands teachers shift from \"the sage on the stage\" to the \"guide on the side\".  I think there are times to be the \"sage on the stage\" -- to exhibit \"unnatural acts\" of thinking (a la\n\nSam Wineburg\n\n-- more re him in a future blog post) -- though overall, I prefer the concept of the teacher as\n\n\"the meddler in the middle\"\n\n(Erica McWilliams, 2005).\n\nIn an interview Benjamin Barber\n\nreflects on the positive aspect of disturbing thoughts:\n\nLondon:\n\nIt occurs to me that you are not at all afraid of controversy — not in your statements here and not in your books certainly. You say somewhere in\n\nAn Aristocracy of Everyone\n\nthat\n\n\"with good teaching, as with good art, someone is always offended.\"\n\nIs that really true?\n\nBarber:\n\nI think so.\n\nI think that if you don't offend someone, you haven't even woken them up, let alone gotten their mental energies going.\n\nOne thing that does bother me about so-called political correctness — I don't like the term PC — it's really an unfair word, it's kind of a slur in the way that it's used. But the true part of it is that there are some people who seem unwilling to be offended and provocative speech, free speech, and most importantly educational speech — speech that makes people think — has to be to some degree offensive. That's how you get people woken up, that's how you get people caring, that's how you get them reacting.\n\nAnother vision of the teacher as a constructive mediator is the\n\ngrandmother\n\n-- in\n\nSugata Mitra\n\n's sense -- in his SOLEs (Self-Organized Learning Environments).  The person who stands behind you every now and then-- who is there to support you in your own learning.\n\nIsn't that the role of our own PLN (personal learning networks) -- for us as teacher-learners?  We just need to make sure we are allowing ourselves to be disturbed.  That is the danger for adults... that we move into spaces (mental and physical) which do not regularly perturb us.\n\n* Yes, \"unknown unknowns\" brings Donald Rumsfeld to mind -- and my favorite packaging of him is in the 2003\n\nSlate article on \"The Poetry of Donald Rumsfeld\"\n\n:\n\nThe Unknown\n\nAs we know,\n\nThere are known knowns.\n\nThere are things we know we know.\n\nWe also know\n\nThere are known unknowns.\n\nThat is to say\n\nWe know there are some things\n\nWe do not know.\n\nBut there are also unknown unknowns,\n\nThe ones we don't know\n\nWe don't know.\n\n—Feb. 12, 2002, Department of Defense news briefing",

      "title": "OUT OF THE DRAFTS FOLDER: (2009) An Injection of Ideas on Library Design",
      "content": "How many draft blog posts do you have sitting around?  Here is one from two years ago -- on library design.  I never got around to publishing it, so am doing so now - with the intent of posting a recent update of thoughts and resources, especially after hearing of a recent Kevin Hennah consultation in Kuala Lumpur with international school librarians.\n\nOn August 22nd [2009] about 30 international school librarians from around Asia gathered at ISB in Bangkok for a one-day workshop on library design by\n\nKevin Hennah\n\n, a retail merchandising consultant and designer who has done a lot of  work with libraries in Australia.\n\n(While he seems to have worked with many major companies, it was this advertising campaign in his portfolio that made the biggest visual impression on me:\n\nAustralia Post: If you really want to touch someone, send them a letter\n\n.  I should also mention his featured section in the Australian book,\n\nRethink! Ideas for Inspiring School Library Design\n\n-- and I think he said he's working on a book with\n\nOpening the Book\n\nin the UK. )\n\nThe success of the workshop can be summed up by Barb Philip's comment as she walked out: \"I feel like taking a sledgehammer to my library.\"\n\nWhat did he say? Well, others who attended the workshop have been much more efficient in sharing about it online. Within 24 hours\n\nKim Cofino, one of the event organizers, had blogged about it\n\nand\n\nTara Ethridge, the other event organizer, blogged about it\n\non Monday the 24th.\n\nAnthony Tilke posted information about it on the ECIS iSkoodle forum for librarians\n\n(registration required to view)\n\n, and\n\nBeth Gourley made public her Evernote notebook on\n\nLibrary as Space and Place\n\n, which includes her notes on Kevin's presentation.\n\nWhat can I add?  A few extension links, perhaps...\n\nKevin's value was in his slideshow presentation -- talk about visual learning! We saw over 600 images, illustrating retail principles in practice in libraries. He talked us through before-and-after shots, good examples, bad examples, interesting examples. (And, no, for copyright reasons, he said he couldn't give us copies of his presentation.)\n\nAs Kevin spoke, I kept scribbling down the names of the libraries being shown (mainly Australian and more public than school ones) -- see the\n\nlist of libraries\n\nhere. I tried to find images of them on the internet, without much success -- except for\n\nThe Idea Stores\n\nin London (UK), e.g.,\n\nsearch of Flickr for \"idea store\" and \"library\"\n\n.\n\nInstead you might have a look at some of these libraries:\n\nThe Robin Hood project\n\nin New York City, where prominent architects went in and re-vamped poor school libraries. See\n\n\"The Library Book\"\n\nhere.  See also\n\nMaira Kalman's video clip of how she created one library's alphabet display\n\n.\n\nDOK\n\nInfoToday: Discover Innovations at DOK, Holland’s 'Library Concept Center';\n\nDOK Delft's Flickr photos\n\nshowing their library's design and interior'\n\nDOK Library Concept Center -- Flickr photos from The Shifted Librarian\n\nI was familiar with the retail design approaches in libraries -- as\n\nPaco Underhill\n\n's book \"\n\nWhy We Buy: The Science of Shopping\n\n\" became popular with librarians in the US several years ago, e.g.,  see the Library Journal article\n\n\"Power Users - Designing buildings and services from the end user's viewpoint transforms access for everyone\n\n\" [2005], as well as  \"\n\nWhat libraries can learn from bookstores: Applying bookstore design to public libraries\n\n\" [2003].  But it's always good to have it re-iterated.\n\nHe recommends a \"What's Hot?\" display (see how\n\nBarb went back and immediately put that up on the wall in her library\n\n).\n\nKevin is all for ditching Dewey and using more user-friendly, bookstore-type categories to organize books. He cited the Palmerston Public Library (NT, Australia) as an example of a library choosing to organize the collection in terms of\n\n17 \"living rooms\" or categories\n\n(read this 2006 white paper \"\n\nWhere's the Dewey?\n\n\" for background on the process they went through).\n\nSimilar attempts:\n\nIt's Fine To Drop Dewey - 7/15/2009 - Library Journal\n\n-- article re another US library ditching Dewey;\n\nRangeview Library District, CO, First System To Fully Drop Dewey - 6/5/2009 - Library Journal;\n\nBehind the Maricopa County Library District’s Dewey-less Plan - 5/31/2007 - Library Journal\n\nLibrary Matters: To Dewey or not to Dewey . . .\n\n-- re a NZ library considering it;\n\nArizona Library Ditches Dewey - 7/1/2007 - School Library Journal\n\nFreeing Dewey\n\n-- a blog from a US public library in the process of dropping Dewey;\n\nLibraryThing's\n\nOpen Shelves Classification (OSC) Project\n\n-- a free, \"humble,\" modern, open-source, crowd-sourced replacement for the Dewey Decimal System;\n\nThe\n\nNational Library of Singapore\n\nhas its own variation on re-grouping Dewey, supposedly to help the public find books, but I find it confusing -- as the catalog just gives me the Dewey number - so I have to wander to find the section that Dewey number is stored in.\n\nOne thing I do like about the NLB shelves is the use of\n\nColorMarq\n\n, a library shelf ID system where each letter of the alphabet has a different color.  It makes it easy to see when a book is mis-shelved.  (I do have a problem when NLB shelvers only bother to sort by the first three letters of the authors' names.... especially in areas like BRO or WIL.)\n\n[Photos by me]",

      "title": "Carol Kuhlthau meets Tim Brown: Guided Inquiry {Design} Thinking",
      "content": "Two books have been guiding my thinking about research & inquiry cycles for the past couple of years.\n\na)\n\nChange by Design\n\n-- by Tim Brown, of IDEO \"design thinking\" fame.  His framework is not explicitly educational, though IDEO have published\n\na toolkit of design thinking for educators\n\n.\n\nb)\n\nGuided Inquiry Design: a framework for Inquiry in your School\n\n-- by\n\nCarol C. Kuhlthau\n\n, Leslie K. Maniotes, and Ann K. Caspari.  Kuhlthau is the grand dame of teacher-librarianship and the one who first recognized the emotional element involved in the ISP (Information Search Process) back in 1991.\n\nFor me, the most important feature they share is the recognition of that\n\nemotional element\n\nin research.  We all get discouraged - or should.  If you don't experience any dip in confidence, then it means you're not really pushing yourself in terms of researching.   Tim's sketch illustrates Carol's original insight very well.\n\nTim's design process is an incredibly simple iterative cycle between\n\nInspiration\n\n,\n\nIdeation\n\n, and\n\nImplementation\n\n(below is my sketch) -- but I think it works just as well in terms of research.\n\nCarol's latest framework is more expansive, incorporating 8 \"verb\" steps (mirroring her older ISP \"noun\" stages - shown in parentheses) :\n\nOpen\n\n(Initiation)\n\nInvitation to inquiry\n\nOpen minds\n\nStimulate curiosity\n\nImmerse\n\n(Selection)\n\nBuild background knowledge\n\nConnect to content\n\nDiscover interesting ideas\n\nExplore\n\n(Exploration)\n\nExplore interesting ideas\n\nLook around\n\nDip in\n\nIdentify\n\n(Formulation)\n\nPause and ponder\n\nIdentify inquiry questions\n\nDecide direction\n\nGather\n\n(Collection)\n\nGather important information\n\nGo broad\n\nGo deep\n\nCreate\n\n(Presentation)\n\nReflect on learning\n\nGo beyond facts to make meaning\n\nCreate to communicate\n\nShare\n\n(Presentation)\n\nLearn from each other\n\nSharing learning\n\nTell your story\n\nEvaluate\n\n(Assessment)\n\nEvaluate achievement of learning goals\n\nReflect on content\n\nReflect on process\n\nCarol's book offers plenty of practical suggestions for implementing inquiry in schools, e.g., she stresses the need for an\n\nInquiry Journal\n\n(a workspace for individual composing and reflection) as well as\n\nInquiry Charts\n\n(attempts to visualize ideas, connections, questions, etc.) and an\n\nInquiry Log\n\n(a record of sources consulted), but one of the most important points she makes is the crucial distinction between the Explore and the Gather stages.\n\nThe\n\nExplore\n\nstage is about\n\nbrowsing\n\n,\n\nscanning\n\n, and\n\nskimming\n\n.\n\n\"Dipping in\"\n\nmeans you need to relax, read, and reflect.  Sources should just be tracked in the Inquiry Log at this point.\n\nThe\n\nGather\n\nstage is about\n\ndetailed note-taking\n\n,\n\ncomprehensive searching\n\n, and\n\n\"going deep\"\n\n.  This is also the stage when you need to thinking about citing, quoting, and paraphrasing. Too often students think they have to take detailed notes on a source the first time they encounter it - before they have decided on an inquiry focus.\n\nAgain, Tim has a simple distinction which I think epitomizes the difference.\n\nHere I have added just two extra descriptions:\n\nFinding Out\n\nvs.\n\nSorting Out\n\n(a la Kath Murdoch)\n\nWhen talking to students, I now like to have them clarify which mode they think they are currently in.  And the emotional dip of uncertainty is often a sign that's time for the shift.  What a metacognitive skill -- to know how much first stage searching is enough to work with -- to have enough choices.\n\nThis is Carol's\n\nIdentify\n\nstage -- which is about focusing and establishing a meaningful inquiry question -- when the thinking shifts from divergent (broad) to convergent (deep).\n\nTim Brown insists all ideas (i.e., research questions) must be analyzed in light of three criteria:\n\nDesirability\n\n(personal interest/passion),\n\nViability\n\n(for Tim this means \"makes business sense,\" but in the educational realm it translates to \"fits the assignment or criteria\" and satisfies the big \"so what?\"), and\n\nFeasibility\n\n(the time and resources to actually complete the project).\n\nSimilarly, Carol asks students to consider their question in terms of the assigned task, their own interest, the time available, and the information and resources available.\n\nI think Tim's four basic illustrations concisely convey the key stages of research better than Carol's more elaborate theory.  I still want her book on my shelf, but, until I can get more teachers to read and absorb it, I'll be using Tim's ideas and images in conversation.",

      "content": "\"How many books are there in the library and what are the annual circulation statistics?\"\n\nsays the secondary school administrator.\n\nMy first response is,\n\nwhat do you think that measures?\n\nOkay, it's budget allocation time, so the underlying issue is financial competition with other development goals.  It's a request to justify the collection we're building as a new secondary school, finishing our second year of operation.\n\nBut let's start with the devil in the detail of\n\nour circulation statistics\n\n.\n\nBrowsing vs. Check-out:\n\nA lot of books are taken off the shelf, but don't get taken out.  They're read  in the library, then left on tables.  Every day we have to go around and pick them up.  The most popular browsing material seems to be self-help and well-being books (yes, this includes sex-ed), art and photography books, poetry, graphic format (think: cartoons, comics and manga), middle-school novels (because: teachers regularly bring their classes in for free-choice, silent sustained reading), and Chinese-language books (reasons: various).\n\nThe fact that we're open until 9:30pm four nights a week for boarding house study time increases students' browsing potential within the library -- without having to check books out.\n\nIn-library-use-only Displays:\n\nLarge numbers of curriculum-related books are kept on display tables while a grade has a particular focus - and students are asked NOT to take them out, for mass maximum access.  Students' ability to scan-to-PDF pages or chapters from books makes in-library-use-only more manageable.  Recent displays have supported units on peace and conflict resolution, human rights and up-standers/heroes, the Vietnam war, religions of the world, genetics, South Africa, etc.\n\nLibrary resources are intertwined with those of the English Dept.\n\n-- so our circulation statistics should be considered jointly.\n\nSome English teachers use the school library for their class library, checking out a box of books for in-class circulation over a long period.\n\nMultiple copies of titles bought by the English Dept. are available on library shelves for general loan -- when not needed by a particular teacher -- rather than letting them languish in departmental book cupboards.\n\nThe library buys multiple copies of recently-published titles as part of the annual\n\nRed Dot Book Awards\n\n, and those books are automatically shifted to the English Dept. (both in the catalog and on the shelves) each June.\n\nIn such a new library, large numbers of new items are constantly being added.\n\nMany resources haven't had much chance to be discovered and taken out.\n\nEach school will have its own context that weakens the power of plain circulation statistics.\n\nWhat is the ideal number of books in a secondary school library?\n\nIn different countries at different times, school library associations, whether national or regional, have cited research and quoted numbers.  12? 16? 20? 36? books per student?  I know schools that swear by each of those.\n\nBut what are we counting?  Just physical books?\n\nOur collection size and substance\n\nis definitely affected by students' access to digital resources, due to our 1:1 Macbook program for grades 6-12.\n\nTo start with, we have no need for a separate reference section -- as databases provide that so well.\n\nWhat doesn't the internet deliver as well as physical volumes in a school library?\n\nLarge-format art and design books\n\n-- ones you can spread out on a table and see many images at once.  Big beautiful books to browse.\n\nGraphic novels and sophisticated picture books.\n\nSame idea.  Big visuals.\n\nPoetry\n\n.  Yes, you can find poems on websites, but due to copyright you can't find whole collections of one poet.  And so many poetry books are physical works of art in themselves.\n\nPlayscripts.\n\nAgain, a collection not accessed every day by everyone, but a godsend to someone interested in drama.\n\nSpecial collections\n\nin one physical location, available for browsing -- Singapore books, self-help and well-being books, third-culture kids and global nomad books, \"vintage\" books (books published prior to 1950, culled from piles of donations, are a fascination to our students).  World languages (mother-tongue) collections come under this category, too.\n\nBooks the average person isn't going to buy for their home library.\n\nFor example, The Complete Illustrated and Annotated Letters of Vincent Van \nGogh.  Price: Expensive. Who is reading this, you ask?  Not just the art\n teachers.  Yes, they're assigning it -- because they're thrilled to \nhave it available.\n\nNarrative and visual non-fiction\n\n-- about science, math, history, etc.  Biographies fall in this category.\n\nExperience with non-fiction book layout standards\n\n-- e.g., how to use a table of contents, index, appendices, etc.   I find middle school teachers are particularly concerned with giving their students access to and experience with non-fiction books precisely because the internet doesn't easily allow them to absorb the conventions of research texts. I'd prefer to let databases provide (up-to-date) access to basic science, humanities, and geography information, but the teachers are still requesting a physical collection.\n\nFiction.\n\nWe're still delivering fiction via physical books for the time being.\n\nWhile ebooks are growing in popularity and availability, the software to be able to lend ebooks (e.g., Overdrive) isn't cheap or doesn't have a good enough interface yet (e.g., Destiny), plus the whole DRM (digital rights management) situation isn't easy.  Several international school libraries have bought the ebook lending software only to find the books their students want to read aren't available as ebooks (legally) outside the US or UK.\n\nOur students spend a lot of time in front of a screen and when we have tried to deliver English-class texts digitally (e.g., for works out of copyright and readily available in epub format), there has been push-back. The school's standard-issue laptop isn't the ideal ebook device.  I am also not convinced that the library should invest in mobile ereaders to lend out.\n\nDiscoverability -- seeing what's available to borrow -- is also much harder with a digital loan collection.  It's not like sweeping your eyes over a bookshelf.  (I find Overdrive very frustrating on the browsing-for-titles front.)\n\nMaking the virtual visible is one of my library mantras.\n\nNot just making the library's digital presence visually evident, but also creating a physical space that provides a sense of the world's knowledge\n\n-- organized in some fashion.  The environment is the \"third\" teacher --  therefore the library, as a physical space, should be a powerful influence upon learning.\n\nW\n\nhat I think the library space needs to do better is to connect the user with the online resources that complement and expand the physical resources on the shelf.  To let digital nuggets convince you to read a whole book; it could be a video of the author speaking or an animated illustration of a book's argument or just a great article related to the book, freely available online.\n\nI never answered the question of how many books is enough.  This comes back to the question of what we want to measure in the library - and how it can be measured.  I'll save my proposed dashboard for a separate post.\n\nImages via Flickr:\n\nBooks and Books by Kara Allyson\n\nAvian books 34 by Mal Booth\n\nThe book by giopuo",

      "content": "If you want to have a good read about the history and future of the \"making\" movement in education and tinkering as \"a mindset for learning,\" I highly recommend the book\n\n\"Invent to Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom -- by Sylvia Libow Martinez and Gary Stager\n\n.\n\nGo to their website for an overview of the chapters, with links to extended resources for each.\n\nThe best thing it did was to send me back to read/re-read\n\nSeymour Papert\n\n, the grandfather of the movement.  (I didn't realize the roots of his projects were in Maine.)\n\nI also refreshed my acquaintance with the writings of\n\nMitchel Resnick\n\n(head of the MIT Lifelong Kindergarten group) re the cycle of imagine, create, play, share, reflect, imagine.  And a biography of Nikola Tesla is on my \"to read\" list.\n\nA few notes/quotes from the book:\n\nStager's hypothesis:  \"A good prompt is worth a thousand words.\" -- where 'good' means it has (a) brevity (e.g., can fit on a post-it note), (b) ambiguity (let the learner be free to satisfy the prompt in their own voice), and (c) has immunity to assessment. (60-61)\n\nLearners can exceed expectations with the following four variables in place:\n\n-- a good prompt, motivating challenge, or thoughtful question\n\n-- appropriate materials\n\n-- sufficient time\n\n-- a supportive culture, including a range of expertise (60)\n\n\"Great teachers know that their highest calling is to make memories.\" (67)\n\n\"Constructivism is a theory of learning that doesn't mandate a specified method of teaching.... Constructionism is a theory of teaching.  We believe that constructionism is the best way to implement constructivist learning.\" (71)\n\nAdvice: skip the pre-load, don't overteach planning, encourage continuous improvement, allow reflection. (77)\n\nAssessment interrupts the learning process.  Even asking a kid what they're doing is disruptive. (81)\n\n\"Writing, filmmaking, and presenting information are the low-hanging fruit of creative expression in the digital age.\" (84)\n\n\"The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge.\" -- Seymour Papert (157)\n\nEducators need to be reminded that it is possible to learn without being taught. (202)\n\nReading the book, I remembered my father's workshop down cellar in the house in Maine where I grew up.  We loved to make things with him.  My biggest project was a bookcase that would double as my bed's headboard.  Mainly we marveled at how he could fix things.  He was definitely a tinkerer.\n\nA few years ago it was time to clear the workshop out.  After all, he'd been dead for some twenty years and no one was using it.  But I took some last photos.\n\nFull Flickr set here",

      "content": "I started this year's\n\nALA\n\n* (\n\n#ALA2013\n\n) experience with two very practical all-day pre-conference workshops.\n\nLibrary Makerspaces: The Field Trip\n\n-- at the Chicago Public Library, which focused on \nthe spaces being created to allow  kids to experience hands-on tinkering, especially with flexible, \ninexpensive digital/electronic components.  Various people presented, on various aspects. All-day interesting.  Separate blog post coming.\n\nRDA: Back to the Basics\n\n-- which explained, in illuminating detail, the benefits to libraries of the new metadata\n\nResource Description and Access\n\nstandard and how to gradually implement it via existing MARC data records.  Welcome, worthwhile. Separate blog post coming.\n\nThe conference itself involved shorter sessions.  Highlights included:\n\nCrossing the K-20 Continuum: Are Librarians Bridging Information Literacy and 21st Century Skills?\n\n--\n\na panel discussion by Kenneth Murhanna, from Kent State University, director of the\n\nTRAILS\n\nproject and author of the new book,\n\nInformed Transitions: Libraries Supporting the High School to College Transition\n\n-- see\n\nhis presentation slides (\"Battling the Unready\") here\n\n-- and Tasha Bergson-Michelson, a Google Search Educator moving in September to a girls-only high school in Palo Alto (\n\nhttp://library.castilleja.org/\n\n) -- see her presentation slides at\n\nbit.ly/SearchSources\n\n.\n\nFriction: Teaching Slow Thinking and Intentionality in Online Research\n\n-- a presentation by Debbie Abilock (NoodleTools) and Tasha Bergson-Michelson again (see above).\n\nSee presentation slides here.\n\nNot only was I thrilled to finally meet Debbie in person, having known and interacted with her online for years, but this was one of the few sessions which managed to involve the audience effectively.  If you go to\n\nhttp://bit.ly/FrictionALA\n\n, you can get links to the ten Google Docs used to record the small group discussions.\n\nI liked the idea of focusing on \"friction points\" in the research process -- where students could or should be prompted to use System Two thinking (as in Daniel Kahneman's book, \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" - one of my favorites).  More on on this in another blog post.\n\nStudying Ourselves: Libraries and the User Experience\n\n--\n\na panel presentation by a professor and two university librarians, each of whom had studied the library environment -- and students' use of the library -- using sociological and/or anthropological research methods.  The sociology professor, Andrew Abbott, was particularly fascinating.  Again, more in another blog post.\n\nLibrarARy Orientation: Augmented Reality in the Library:  Reality\n\n-- a quick session by the University of Houston librarians on how they are using Aurasma, a free augmented reality app, to enhance their library orientation sessions.\n\nClick here\n\nfor their Prezi presentation.  I had already played with Aurasma and found it interesting to see how they were using it.  More on this later.\n\nBleak New World: YA Authors Decode Dystopia\n\n-- a panel discussion by four top-notch dystopia authors, from old to young:\n\nLois Lowry\n\n(\"The Giver\"),\n\nCory Doctorow\n\n(\"Little Brother\"),\n\nPatrick Ness\n\n(\"The Knife of Never Letting Go\"), and\n\nVeronica Roth\n\n(\"Insurgent\").  As Ness said, the best YA books promote the question, \"what would you do if....?\" And another of them said, dystopia is not a story, but a way to tell a story.\n\nJaron Lanier: Who Owns the Future?\n\n-- An auditorium presentation by a major player in the making of today's digital world, unafraid to criticize it with compelling economic arguments in\n\nhis new book\n\n.  Also thoroughly charming. I'm a long-time follower of his thinking, so I felt like it was a fireside chat with an old friend, bringing up scary topics (too true, big data is a big danger), but also reassuring that we can change history by raising awareness at critical moments. (What a lovable hippie....).  Google him for all kinds of resources, starting with\n\nhis homepage\n\n.\n\nPing Fu: Bend Not Break\n\n-- An auditorium \npresentation by a woman who grew up in the worst of China's Cultural Revolution and today is a cutting edge American entrepreneur in the 3D digital \"maker\" space, thanks to her company,\n\nGeomagic\n\n.  Her story is fascinating - as she started out doing comparative literature in China, while computer science was her ticket to success in the States.  In the photo below, note her her shoes and scarf are both 3D-printed objects.\n\nFor more info re her book, see her website:\n\nbendnotbreak.com\n\n-- though she has come under a lot of scrutiny for some of her depictions of the Cultural Revolution.  Has she exaggerated or mis-remembered?  Google it yourself, if you're interested in the controversy.  I still enjoyed listening to a rags-to-riches-via-technology American immigrant woman on stage -- and hope some of my students will read her autobiography.\n\nBeyond Genre: Exploring the Perception, Uses, and Misuses of Genres by Readers, Writers, etc.\n\n-- a panel discussion by three popular writers (for adults, not teens or children) -- crime novelist\n\nLaura Lippman\n\n(wife of David Simon, if that name means anything to you fans of \"The Wire\"),\n\nMargaret Dilloway\n\n, and\n\nNaomi Novik\n\n, fantasy writer and analyst of fandom fiction.  All new-to-me authors.  The comments that stuck with me include:   \"Never forget, literature can be done within genre; the author is potentially limited, not the form.\"  Also a reminder of the benefit of genre lists, i.e., booklists that help young people in a library looking for the next thing to read.  NB:  Since the session the organizers have posted a long list of resources related to genres -- it's well worth a look:\n\nBeyond Genre: Research and Trends PDF\n\n.\n\nNext year ALA is in Las Vegas, a place I would normally not go near.  Now it sounds quite attractive.\n\n*ALA - the American Library Association's annual conference, held at the end of June (convenient for those of us on the northern hemisphere school calendar - and for me regularly winging my way from Singapore to Maine - so any US city is \"on the way\".... this year it was Chicago...).  A conference that attracts 26,000 librarians/attendees.  Yes, think mega-library.  Below is a photo which gives an idea of the expanse of the exhibition space -- which I navigated, iPhone in hand, snapping books and ideas to pursue later.\n\nAll photos taken by me.",

      "content": "The\n\nRed Dot book awards\n\n(\n\nreddotawards.com\n\n) are one of those hybrid awards:  students vote on shortlists selected by adults (school librarians).  Eight books in four categories, one winner in each -- followed by a Readers Cup competition between international schools here in Singapore.\n\n\"But what's the mission statement?  Good literature or just promoting books from various countries?\"\n\nsomeone asked as we gathered to sort through the longlists of the four categories this year.\n\nMy gut response was \"good literature from various countries.\"\n\nThe\n\nawards website's \"About\" page\n\nsays:\n\nThe Red Dot categories are roughly based on readers,\n rather than book formats or school divisions.  (NB: It is up to every \nlibrarian to determine which books are right for which classes in your \nschool to read.)\n\nEarly Years\n\n(ages 3-7)\n\n--\n\nformerly\n\nPicture Books\n\nYounger Readers\n\n(ages 7-10)\n\n--\n\nformerly\n\nJunior\n\n) --\n\n(where\n\nCaptain Underpants\n\nand\n\nGeronimo Stilton\n\nare the assumed reading level)\n\nOlder Readers\n\n(ages 10-14)\n\n--\n\nformerly\n\nMiddle\n\n) -- (where\n\nInkheart\n\nand\n\nThe Lightning Thief\n\nare the assumed reading level)\n\nMature Readers\n\n(ages 14-adult)\n\n--\n\n(formerly\n\nSenior\n\n) --  (where\n\nTwilight\n\nand\n\nThe Book Thief\n\nare the assumed reading level)\n\nShortlist titles are chosen by a committee of teacher-librarians from\n\nrecent\n children's literature (first published in English within the past four \nyears), with the goal of offering a range of books from around the world\n\n.\n\nThe initiative is now entering its fifth year, just long enough for its origins to deserve review -- especially given our transient teaching population.\n\n2009 - 2010 website\n\n2010 - 2011 website\n\n2011 - 2012 website\n\n2012 - 2013 website\n\n2013 - 2014 - website under development\n\nAs one of its creators, it was interesting for me to go back through the minutes of meetings and  posts in the Google Group of our local network -\n\nISLN\n\n(International Schools Library Network - Singapore) and remember how it developed.\n\nFirst there was Barb Philip Reid, a NZ/Australian teacher-librarian at Tanglin Trust School, back in September 2008 wanting to get a Readers Cup going between all our schools, similar to the\n\nReaders Cup in Australia\n\n.   As research, she and I did a librarians-on-tour trip to Hong Kong in May 2009 to watch the finale of the\n\nannual Battle of the Books\n\n(based on a well-established American model) run by their international school library network,\n\nALESS\n\n.\n\nAt the same time I had been wanting to get an annual international students-voting book award going in Singapore, inspired by the\n\nPanda Book Awards\n\ncreated by SLIC (School Librarians in China) and the\n\nSakura Medal\n\nstarted by the international school librarians in Japan.  (The French international schools in Asia run a similar program: see\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n\n-- and there is now the\n\nMorning Calm Medal\n\nin South Korea.)\n\nBarb and I figured, why not combine the two ambitions and start an annual book \naward program, whose shortlists would become the source of the Readers Cup \ncompetition booklists.  Introduce the books in Oct/Nov, vote in March, \nand the three older categories (as shown) would compete in May.\n\nYounger Readers - Year 3, 4 & 5 / Grade 2, 3 & 4\n\nOlder Readers - Year 5, 6, 7, & 8 / Grade 4, 5, 6 & 7\n\nMature Readers - Year 8+ / Grade 7+\n\nOur booklists would then necessarily be \"formative\" ones, meaning only fairly recent literature, in contrast to the \"summative\" kind most \"Battle of the Books\" (Google it) use, mixing old and new titles.  Both have their place.  The \"summative\" approach guarantees kids don't miss great books from any era.  The \"formative\" ensures students and teachers are exposed to the best of the latest -- and encourages schools to buy multiple copies of new titles every year, potentially freshening up the book cupboards.\n\nWe got a committee together and in October 2009 it was announced the award would be called the \"Red Dots\" (as\n\nSingapore is proud of that epithet\n\n).   The shortlists followed in November, with 14 schools immediately signing up to participate, including a British school, an American \nschool, a German school, a French school, a Canadian school, an \nAustralian school, plus just plain Anglo-heritage/international ones.  And so it started, and has continued, with some variation in implementation.\n\nEach school can do what they want with the lists.  Buy them all or only a selection.  Participate in voting or not.  Participate in the Readers Cup or not.  Give your students different criteria for choosing one book to vote for in each category.  (Your personal favorite? The one you would recommend to friends the most?)  We only say students should probably have read at least two books in a category in order to make a choice.  We do expect just one vote per student per category.  Results are tallied by category and school, and then for all the schools, giving us overall winners.\n\nAn International Approach (in Singapore)\n\nBut back to the question, how do we choose titles?   What assumptions has the committee been working on over the past five years?\n\nBarb and I did a presentation at the 2010 IASL (International Association of School Librarians) in Brisbane, Australia, on \"Creating Internationally Literate Readers\" (see\n\nthe workshop website\n\nand\n\nour conference paper\n\n), which recounted the Red Dot story and summarized the challenges we face in choosing books suitable for and accessible to the wide range of students in our various international schools.\n\nWe brought up the danger of the single story (a la Chimamanda Adichie's TED talk) and the need for books to serve as both mirrors and windows of culture for children, especially given the predominance of \"third culture\" kids in our schools.  We showed examples of books that bridge cultures well - and others that are problematic.  For example, the question always has to be asked, is this book too American? too British? too Australian? too Canadian? too Singaporean? etc.\n\nThere are so many factors, but these are the major ones considered for the Red Dot books:\n\nPublication date\n\n:  published in English within the past four years.  That seems to increase the chance that books are available in paperback.  It also allows enough time for us to take advantage of other/national book awards which may be limited to just the past year - we can choose from their backlists.\n\nCost and ease of access\n\n:  If a book is perfect, but not available through our regular book-buying channels, or only available in hardcover, we hesitate to choose it.  Likewise, if a book is available as an ebook as well as print, that would give it extra points.  Everyone runs their Red Dot program differently, but we assume multiple copies will be purchased.\n\nGenres\n\n:  with only eight titles per category, variety is desirable, but there is no formula.  One non-fiction? One poetry or verse novel? One graphic novel? One fantasy? One historical fiction?   One book in translation?  One book featuring global concerns, like child labor or refugees or war? There has been talk of starting a separate category for graphic novels.  Maybe next year?\n\nReading Level vs. Reader Maturity Level\n\n:  This is the hardest thing to gauge.  Where to place a book.  Sometimes we get it wrong.  There is an assumed one year overlap (at least for the Readers Cup) \nbetween Younger and Older Readers, and Older and Mature Readers.  And schools have different comfort levels with language and content.  All we can say is, each librarian is responsible for reading and placing the books in their school.  There is no requirement that each school stock each book.  Students don't have to read all the books in order to vote.\n\nCountry of origin or country of flavor\n\n:  We like to include a book or two in each category that reflects the region.  Having said that, we try not to privilege country of origin over quality.   If there's a good one from Singapore, that's great (especially if the author likes to do school visits), but if not, we would be happy with a good one from, or set in, another Asian country.  Also, no one country of origin should dominate a list.  When in doubt, think international.\n\nLiterary vs. Popular\n\n:  This is the tension in the modified children's choice style of book awards.  They don't pick the longlist or shortlist - they only get to vote.  So are we choosing books we want them to read?  Or books they would choose to read on their own?  Should we choose a book if we already have a sense that it's going to a big hit?  Or avoid the easy choice and try to put another one in their path, a lesser known one that could have just as much appeal?  (Some of our past choices might look like we went for a bestseller, but if you check the dates, we chose them before their massive popularity - e.g., \"The Hunger Games\".)\n\nThe bottom line is, we are buying multiple copies of these books.  They might not have to be texts worth teaching in depth, but if the extra copies are going to be used (after the Red Dot cycle is over) for literature circles or to enhance class libraries, then we want both quality and appeal.  I know I want books my students can possibly make at least two connections with (using the\n\nKeene & Zimmerman / Harvey & Goudvis strategies\n\n):\n\nText-to-Self\n\n-- emotional or personal connections -- think empathy...\n\nText-to-World\n\n-- social or political or historical connections -- relevant issues or introduction to other cultures...\n\nText-to-Text\n\n-- literary/literacy or intellectual connections -- perhaps an author, series, or genre that will keep kids reading...\n\nBalance is Everything\n\nThis means within the list, across the categories, and across the years.  For all the factors above.\n\nI found some old photos of our Red Dot committee shortlist meeting from September 2010.   Here we are:  drinks, nibbles, laptops (note the person being skyped in), smartphones, and books.  I recall it was a marathon session.\n\nAnd here's the whiteboard where the balance of the lists was incessantly being assessed.\n\nThis year we've split into two groups to do the selection:  Early/Younger and Older/Mature.  Time is ticking and we should be finishing our lists within the next two weeks.  There are books to be bought.  And a new website to get up and running.  Watch\n\nreddotawards.com\n\nfor updates......",

      "content": "The last time our school posted a library job, it asked for a\n\nTeacher-Librarian\n\n(TL).*\n\nThis time it says\n\nwe need a\n\nLibrary Facilitator\n\n.  (Apply by October 23!)  Primary or secondary.  (While I'm in secondary now, I'm flexible.)\n\nWhere did the teaching go?  It's still in there, but shifted - from direct to indirect - while retaining learning as the priority.  Read the job responsibilities:\n\nWork collaboratively with library staff across the campus and college.\n\nWork collaboratively with the curriculum leaders and department heads to develop resources and promote inquiry-based learning and all forms of literacy.\n\nWork collaboratively with all members of the community (whether students, parents, or staff) to support teaching and learning.\n\nManage the library as a learning environment and public space, including patron services and library staff.\n\nManage and develop learning resources, physical and digital, both for the library and classrooms/departments.\n\nLead the development and promotion of the library as a centre dedicated to the spread of ideas, information, and learning.\n\nOther responsibilities as determined by the Head of Libraries and Head of Campus.\n\nThe issue is our librarian-student ratio.\n\nWith only two teacher-librarians, one in the primary library and one in the secondary library, and 2,600 students total, the ratio is challenging (to be euphemistic).  We  have roughly 1,000 students in primary and 1,300 students this year in middle/high school (secondary) - and will be adding another 300 students in secondary next year, for a maximum of 2,600 on this new campus.  (And we have a mirror campus across town with 2,900 students, K-12.)\n\nHow can one person \"teach\" 1,000 students?\n\nThey can't.  At least not regularly.  Instead they must focus on developing teachers' capacity (as a coach, modeling lessons and acting as a consultant) and learning resources (from pathfinders via Libguides to videos, podcasts, slide presentations), not to mention running a facility that is a learning space by default (the environment as the 3rd teacher), hosting events and initiatives.   Our libraries are in prominent well-trodden paths.  There's no danger of students not coming into them.  Two major pillars of support are the stalwart library staff and the motivated and multi-talented parent body.  Both are critical to maintaining library sanity.\n\nDid I mention that, at this campus, the library is also responsible for the processing and management of all teaching resources?  This includes textbooks for secondary (where we have them) and reading/writing workshop resources for middle and primary (i.e., literature circles and class libraries).  In addition, the secondary library works closely with departments to ensure multiple copies of great books for each age and subject are available (imagine \"Hot Reads for High School\" across disciplines).\n\nIn this situation, we decided that the librarian half is more important than the teacher half in recruiting a new person.  Hence the word \"facilitator\" over \"teacher\".  We played with several others.  Coach? Curriculum Liaison? Curriculum Developer?  Curriculum Leader?\n\nWe have great teachers.  And we have a great number of resources, digital and physical.  What we need is someone dedicated to connecting the two efficiently.  Perhaps we are just looking for a TL committed to the Flipped Classroom -- who is also excited by metadata.  Because that's what the librarian end should be focusing on -- ensuring easy, intellectual access to everything (the curriculum++) from anywhere.  And this must be accomplished while living in the center of the library, where the students live each day.   It's a front-of-office job with back-of-office responsibilities.\n\nSo consider applying.  Whether you agree with our label or not.  \nWhat's important is that you appreciate our situation and feel you could\n not only cope, but add value.\n\nHead of Library role is another interesting definition to consider.  This is how I describe it at the moment.\n\nDevelop staffing plans and co-ordinate staff recruitment and deployment\n\nCo-ordinate the budget process\n\nRepresent the library team in a variety of settings\n\nFacilitate communication between libraries across the campus and college\n\nDevelop a strategic plan and co-ordinate goal-setting for the libraries\n\nCo-ordinate staff professional development\n\nManage facility planning and development\n\nDevelop library policies and procedures\n\nLiaise with heads of departments &\n\ngrades about policy and procedures relating to the management of learning resources (e.g., textbooks and class libraries)\n\nOversee the provision of information services\n\nComments welcome.... as well as sympathy.\n\nUpdate Oct 15:\n\nI forgot to mention two other very very very important positions that complement the library ones.\n\nThe primary school has two\n\ndigital literacy coaches\n\nas well as one\n\nliteracy coach\n\n(in charge of the reading/writing workshop learning).  There are also two digital literacy coaches in secondary.\n\nSo five other people in the school are supporting other literacies (digital, traditional, etc.) that in a smaller school would probably fall within the teacher-librarian's remit.  Which helps a lot.\n\nI always draw the relationship like this:\n\nAlso note the head of library responsibilities listed above are additional to a basic role.  I have to do that as Head of Library on top of being the secondary school teacher-librarian (or library facilitator).\n\nUpdate Oct 17:\n\nSeveral questions keep coming up.\n\n1)  Is this a teaching position, with a teacher's contract and benefits?  Yes.\n\n2)  Is there library support staff?  Yes.  Lovely, hard-working staff.  And we have just been given approval to advertise for a local-hire, administrative librarian for our campus (the other campus already has one - giving them three fully-qualified librarians, including the TLs).\n\n3)  What about the\n\nonline portfolio\n\nthat must be submitted?\n\nIn addition to the usual requirement for applicants to submit a resume and letter of application, candidates for this position should also submit an online portfolio showing evidence of implementation/innovation in these six overlapping areas of the library:\n\npatrons\n\n;\n\nresources\n\n;\n\nteaching & learning\n\n;\n\nevents & initiatives\n\n;\n\nthe library environment\n\nas \"the 3rd teacher\"; l\n\nibrary staff/team\n\n.\n\nOur campus is moving towards teacher portfolios instead of appraisals, so this seemed a good way to have new staff start off -- by showing us things you've done that you're proud of and that have made a difference to the learning in the institutions you've worked in.  Feel free to interpret the six areas as you will and to fashion a portfolio that suits you.  Just give us something to click.\n\n* For the record, I have always been irritated by the American term, \"Library Media Specialist\".  Years before I became one, I imagined such a person in charge of just CDs and DVDs (ok, it was many years ago).....",

      "content": "We all enjoy the mental exercise of comparing libraries and bookstores as spaces where humans come to interact with books.\n\nLibraries nobly address users' needs (the story goes), while bookstores focus on their wants -- and therefore provide a better browsing experience, being organized for optimum attention rather than intellectual access.\n\nPositing bookstores as the outside competition prompts us to examine and improve discoverability in our library environment -- to increase the likelihood people will find the books they want - or, more importantly, books they didn't even know they wanted.\n\nFirst there's the basic environmental psychology of shopping, which\n\nPaco Underhill\n\nexplained so well in his 1999 book,\n\nWhy We Buy: the science of shopping\n\n-- what I think of as the \"grocery store\" approach. Put the most frequently purchased items at the back of the store, forcing people to walk through the space and be exposed to more merchandise.  Put the tempting last-minute purchases (the candy and gossip magazines) in the checkout aisle.  Make as much stuff face-front display as possible (who buys cereal by looking at the spine of the box?).\n\nMore commonly, talk of implementing bookstore models in libraries is associated with ditching Dewey (e.g.,\n\nsee this September 2012 article\n\nin\n\nSchool Library Journal\n\n) in favor of sections with real names on prominent signs (\"Science Fiction\", \"Sports\", \"Travel\", etc.), not decimal numbers.  Of course, we all ditch Dewey to some degree.  Everyone has an A-Z author-sorted \"Fiction\" section outside the 800s.  Many have a separate \"Biography\" section.  Every collection outside the run of the Dewey numbers can be claimed as a victory by the bookstore model.\n\nThe Magic of Multiple Copies\n\nBut there's one aspect of the bookstore model that most libraries don't or can't reproduce -- having multiple copies on the shelf and potentially more stock \"out back\" somewhere.\n\nIn our library this year, we have started to create \"bookstore\" sections.  Book covers facing out.  Rough grouping by author or genre.  Multiple copies behind the front book. And, most importantly, a paper place-holder sign showing you what book is normally shelved in the spot -- and a QR code to let you see how many copies are still available.\n\nWe started with the English Dept'.s resources, creating a\n\nHot Reads for High School\n\n(\n\nover 250 titles so far\n\n) and a\n\nMiddle School Reading Zone\n\n(\n\nover 170 titles so far\n\n).  Next the Math Dept. came up with a list of books to buy multiple copies, and the Economics Dept. wasn't far behind.  We've put those titles face-front at the beginning of the subject Dewey section in Nonfiction.\n\nThe best thing is - you can booktalk efficiently.  The selection is smaller and definitely selected - by virtue of the curriculum or a teacher or librarian. And there is an instant supply!\n\nBecause that's the usual frustration of a school librarian in front of a group of students - booktalking when only one copy is available.  What if you could booktalk a book and have 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 144+ copies available?\n\nThe project started with our middle school's foray into Reading \nWorkshop, with its focus on literature circles instead of whole-grade \nnovel study, and our Grade 9 English teachers deciding they wanted to \nkick off the year with a wide reading initiative (inspired by Penny \nKittle's\n\nBook Love\n\n) before having to hone in on IGCSE texts.\n\nHow could we quickly produce varied \nclass libraries for 8+ English classrooms per grade level?  Where would these books come from?\n\nSolution: \n Take all the multiple copies previously purchased for whole-class novel study by the English Dept. and make them available to all \nstudents (when not required by a particular teacher).  Then choose some extra titles for purchase, whether in small or large sets, based on curriculum need or teacher/librarian choice.  Finally, for us, add in the multiple \ncopies purchased as part of running of the annual Red Dot\n Awards (\n\nsee history here\n\n).\n\nVoila!  The library as massive class library.  With multiple copies of great books available on the shelf.  This is our \"Best Books for Middle School\" list, our \"This is What Your Child Will Be Reading in English Class\" list, our \"What Your Teacher Recommends\" list.  Parents love it, as do kids.  It's the quick pick-up zone.  The whole Fiction section still has a fantastic selection of books, but students don't have to negotiate it until they are motivated to do so.\n\nI want to focus now on the logistics of our implementation.  Because \nthere always are tricks that make things work, in any given situation.\n\nQ:  How to you keep multiple copies on the shelf?\n\nA:   Our shelves are deep enough to store a stack of books behind a simple \nmetal bookend, bent to hold a front-facing book on display.  The excess \nare kept in a backroom, handy enough that library staff can go retrieve \nthem to replenish the shelf stock or upon request.\n\nQ:  What if all the \"hot reads\" are gone?  How do I know what is all out?\n\nA:  There is still evidence left behind.  No titles out of sight, out of mind. We have made A5 (half of 8.5x11\" sheets, for you Americans) printouts showing the cover plus a QR code and shortened URL -- which take you to the catalog, showing how many copies are still available.\n\nQR codes are magic.  I've liked them from the beginning and have them sprinkled around my library, connecting the visible with the virtual.\n\nI recommend you get\n\nShortenMe\n\nin the Chrome Extension store.  With one click, you get an instant QR code and goo.gl \nURL.\n\nNB: if \nyou're using Follett Destiny, you always need to add your site number at\n the end of the URL before shortening it (e.g., blahblahblah\n\n&site=100\n\n).  Contact me if you use Destiny and don't know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe A5 paper signs go into re-usable stiff plastic \"card cases\". Sample at left.\n\nQ:  How do people know if there are more copies out back?\n\nA:  By scanning the QR code or typing in the Goo.gl shortened URL provided on every display stand -- both of which link into our catalog, e.g.,\n\nclick here\n\nto see availability of\n\nThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas\n\n.\n\nAs mentioned above, this model is being extended into subject \ndepartments in high school, creating pockets of the \"bookstore \nexperience\" within the Dewey run.\n\nMathematics\n\n,\n\nEconomics\n\n, History, and \nDrama are the first.\n\nTo the right are books on the Mathematics shelves in the Dewey section.\n\nWe have virtual walls, too, mirroring these bookstore sections -- thanks to a new HP large-format printer, which can make posters up to 1.x meters in size.  See examples in the slideshow below.",

      "content": "If I could wave a magic wand and improve Follett Destiny as a school library catalog, it would be to improve ways of linking and looking into it.\n\nHere are a few ways to ameliorate the situation.\n\n1)  Share a Destiny link -- the need to add the all-important 'site' information\n\nHave you ever wanted to send a Destiny link to a title, resource list, or copy category to someone?  If so, you know you HAVE TO add:\n\n&site=NUMBER\n\nto the end of the link, where NUMBER is usually 100, 101, 102, 103, etc.\n\nWe host our own catalog, so that's all we have to do.  I just learned that if Follett hosts your catalog, you also have to add:\n\n&context=BLAH\n\nFor example:  &context=saas18_8553630&site=100\n\nYou can see your particular site information by hovering over the link that gets you into your particular catalog.  For example, our Dover Secondary library is site 100, our Dover Primary library is site 101, our East Primary library is 102, and our East Secondary library is 103.  So that information is added to any link we send to anyone.\n\nUpdate 12Apr14:\n\nIf Follett hosts your catalog and you need to find your CONTEXT number, look at the URL when you see all your catalogs displayed -- and it will be at the end of the URL:\n\n2)  Get a Destiny link -- to a set of search results\n\nIf you want to send someone a \"canned\" (\"tinned\"?) search -- such that they can dynamically search the catalog by clicking on a link, you need to edit the URL.\n\nFor example, suppose I want to send someone a link that will do a keyword search on \"economics\".  I put \"economics\" in the Basic Search box and press Enter.  The URL that results is not reproducible -- you can't send it to someone and get the same results.  Instead you need to choose \"Refine your search\" and work with that URL.\n\nWhen you get that URL, you need to change the word \"present\" to \"handle\":\n\nLastly, I have to add the site/context info, e.g., here is the final URL.\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/\n\nhandle\n\nbasicsearchform.do?keywordText=\n\neconomics\n\n&siteTypeID=-2&searchType=keyword&siteID=&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&mediaSiteID=&doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nThe URL above\n\nwill do a keyword search on \"economics\" for the East Second Library of UWCSEA and present the results.\n\nNote:  You can also use DQL (Destiny Query Language) to do a more complicated search out of the Basic search box (because you can't access meaningful URLs based on an Advanced Search).\n\nSee the Destiny Help system for more information, e.g.,\n\n3)  Goodreads -- how to click to check if you already have a Goodreads book in your Destiny catalog\n\nFirst, find a book in Goodreads.  On the Title information page, look for \"online stores\" and \"book links\" at the bottom.  It's the \"Book Links\" bit that you (and your patrons) can customize to go to your school's Destiny catalog to check availability.\n\nAngie Erickson and I presented a workshop on\n\n\"Geeking out with Goodreads\"\n\nin September at the Google Apps Summit here in Singapore -- and put \"how to\" information about integration with Follett Destiny up on a Google Site page here:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/geekingoutwithgoodreads/library-catalog-interfaces\n\n4)  Book Cover Displays -- mirroring bits of your collection via Goodreads or LibraryThing or showing \"Latest Arrivals\" via Pinterest\n\nMany people use Goodreads or LibraryThing to generate book display widgets for parts of their catalog.\n\nBasically, you reproduce a Resource List or Copy Category (i.e., a list of books) in your catalog into Goodreads or LibraryThing or Pinterest -- and then put them on a shelf or board or tag them.\n\nE.g., here is the 2013-2014 Red Dot books for Older Readers -- display out of Goodreads:\n\nISLN\\ \\(Int'l\\ School\\ Library\\ Network\\)'s bookshelf: 2013-2014-short-list-older\n\nISLN (Int'l School Library Network) Singapore's favorite books »\n\nShare\n\nbook reviews\n\nand ratings with ISLN (Int'l School Library Network), and even join a\n\nbook club\n\non Goodreads.\n\nUpdate 12Apr14:\n\nIf you \"pin\" books from within your Destiny catalog (adding the &site=xxx as per above), then when users click through on the board, they will be taken to the title in your catalog.\n\nPinterest, unlike Goodreads and LibraryThing, is a time-sensitive -- last in, first out -- list.  So it's perfect for showing things like \"Latest Arrivals\". (In Destiny Quest, users can see latest arrivals, but only 10 or so and you can't control what is on that list.   Via Pinterest, you can choose the books to advertise.\n\nAnd here are some links to Pinterest boards that show our latest arrivals:\n\nNew -- History books -- East\n\nNew -- Science books -- East\n\nNew -- Economic books -- East\n\n5)  LibraryThing for Libraries -- Book Display Widgets -- linking back to Destiny\n\nLibraryThing for Libraries\n\nhas a javascript\n\nBook Widget generator available via Bowker\n\nfor about US$ 400 -- which allows you to create any number of book display widgets in four different styles that will let people click on a book cover and go directly to that item in your school catalog.\n\nWe're now using it to get beautiful displays of booklists on our Libguide pages, e.g., see our\n\nEconomics: Introduction: Books & Physical Resources\n\nand our\n\nMathematics: Introduction: Books & Physical Resources\n\nguides.\n\nThe widget can take a variety of inputs -- as the screenshot to the right shows.\n\nIf you want to have the book covers displayed link back to your own catalog -- you need to use the \"LibraryThing.com User\".  When you buy the widget generator, you automatically get a LibraryThing account to put books into.  The widget works off LibraryThing \"Collections\" -- so when you enter or import titles, put them in a Collection.\n\nIf you have a Destiny Resource List and want those titles imported into LibraryThing, you can run a \"Title/Copy List\" report out of Destiny -- which includes the ISBN of copies. When the report is displayed, select all and copy the whole text output.  Then in LibraryThing go to \"Add Books\" then \"Import Books\" -- and paste that text into the \"Grab ISBN\" box.  Identify what collection you want them imported into -- then import.\n\nYou can then create a widget based on that collection.\n\nYou can also dump your whole school catalog as MARC records out of Destiny - and LibraryThing will upload them in batch mode -- though you can't identify tags or collections upon import.\n\nIn order to have the widget link back to your catalog, you have to tell LibraryThing how to search your catalog using a URL, e.g.,\n\nISBN search:\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/handlenumbersearchform.do?\n\nsearchOption=3\n\n&searchText=\n\nMAGICNUMBER\n\n&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&siteTypeID=-2&siteID=&mediaSiteID=&doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nTitle search:\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/handlebasicsearchform.do?keywordText=\n\nKEYWORDS\n\n&siteTypeID=101&searchType=title&siteID=&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&mediaSiteID=&doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nAccess-based URL:\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/presenttitledetailform.do?siteTypeID=101&siteID=&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&mediaSiteID=&bibID=\n\nACCESSION\n\n&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nAfter you get these Global Configurations set up, creating the widget is straight-forward.\n\nHere are the four styles available:\n\n3D Carousel example:\n\nDynamic Grid example:\n\nCarousel example:\n\nScrolling example:\n\nNB:  As it's javascript, it's not possible to embed these widgets into Google Sites nor in the Destiny HTML homepage.\n\n6)  Destiny Homepage -- call numbers and collections....\n\nLast but not least, I think we all should be providing better clues about the structure of our catalogs on our Destiny homepages.\n\nWhen I get to somebody's catalog start page, I have no way of knowing how many books they have or how they've organized their collections.  So I'll look at Resource Lists and Visual Search lists, but if people haven't create any -- then it's a blind search box and I have to guess.\n\nIdeally I'd like to create a map showing my library's layout and physical collections as well as digital resources -- and have that on my homepage.\n\nUntil I get around to to doing that, I list all the major call number prefixes on\n\nour Destiny Home Page\n\n.",

      "content": "I have a penchant for schematics.  Below is the one I made while thinking about the types of connections between readers and books -- and ways to enable them.\n\nNote: when choosing ways to connect, three factors must always be considered:  Can it\n\nscale\n\n? (i.e., will it work for large numbers)  Is it easily\n\naccessible\n\n?  How will it be\n\nmaintained\n\n?\n\nWe recently started an initiative that manages to combine all four delivery methods.\n\nThe personal\n\nconnection is that we invite secondary school teachers to identify the books they want to recommend to their students.  The library then buys 3+ copies of those books for the general library collection.\n\nThe virtual\n\nconnection is a booklist of the titles via our library catalog, e.g., see\n\nDr. Alex's Favorites\n\n(where Alex McGregor is the head of History).\n\nThe visual\n\nconnection is a huge skeuomorphic bookshelf poster (thanks to a new big Epson printer and\n\nthis *.jpg of a blank wooden bookshelf\n\n) of the booklist, with a QR code linking to the list.\n\nTo give you an idea of the size, the blank spots on the \"shelf\" are A4 \nsize (8.5\"x11\") so teachers can add books to their shelf (read: maintenance) -- by printing \nout a cover and just blue-tacking it into place.  (Who said cutting and pasting is dead?)  See below example of a poster on a classroom wall.\n\nThe spatial\n\nconnection is a display shelf in the library where multiple copies of each book are displayed - in a very visible way.  (The wall posters are also displayed, but as A4 size in acrylic holders.)\n\nThe books are placed face-out with the extra copies stacked behind -- and in the event that all copies are gone, we have a mini-poster (another visual connection) which is a piece of paper inside a plastic sleeve -- which has a QR code and shortened URL leading to the title in the library catalog, so people can check how many copies are available.  I always complain you can't see what books are missing when looking at a shelf -- this way you can permanently display the most important or popular titles.\n\nWill we have room for all the teachers' selections?  We'll find the space....\n\nClick here\n\nfor a Google Presentation showing all the book wall posters made so far.\n\nNext I want to some teachers to write up little booktalking blurbs and see if we can hang them off the metal holders -- the way independent bookstores do.....",

      "content": "A huge thank-you to Karli Downey and her team at Jerudong International School in Brunei for hosting a valuable two-day workshop for international school librarians, Feb. 21-22, 2014.  About thirty of us came together from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and Brunei to share our practice and thoughts.\n\nSee the\n\nLKSW Libguide\n\nfor an overview.\n\nThe highlights for me included:\n\nLyn Hay\n\n, from\n\nSybaAcademy\n\nand Charles Sturt University, spoke on the concept of the iCentre (\n\nsee her slides here\n\n)\n\nRead on: Mal Lee blog:\n\nhttp://schoolevolutionarystages.net/\n\nand \"digital normalization\"\n\nLyn Hay also spoke about\n\nguided inquiry\n\n-- and\n\nLinda Twitchett (AISS) spoke\n\nabout how she developed a scope and sequence of information fluency for her secondary school.\n\nAs Lyn listed the\n\nseven survival skills a la Tony Wagner\n\n, I mentally tried to remember the 9 elements of our\n\nUWCSEA profile\n\n:  Qualities ( Commitment to Care, Principled, Resilient, Self-Aware) and Skills (Critical Thinker, Creative, Collaborative, Communicator, Self-Manager).  Information fluency/literacy is implicit in the descriptions of each.\n\nMade me realize our library team needs to schedule time with our curriculum dept to continue to hash out our own research model.  Linda came up with four main stages:\n\nExploring\n\n,\n\nInvestigating\n\n,\n\nProcessing\n\n, and\n\nCreating\n\n.  Our middle school has most recently settled on five stages:\n\nIdentify and ask relevant questions\n\nGather and organise information from different perspectives\n\nAnalyse, synthesise and evaluate information\n\nCommunicate\n\nReflection\n\nMade me re-read my blog post on \"\n\nCarol Kuhlthau meets Tim Brown: Guided {Design} Inquiry\n\n\"\n\nLyn highly recommended Keri Smith's book,\n\nHow to be an explorer of the world\n\n-- which is one of those books I hesitate to buy for the library, as it's meant to be written in and personalised.\n\nCheck out\n\nLinda's Libguide on Research\n\n.\n\nCrys Mills reminded us of some great Australian picture books -- I put\n\nthe list here in LibraryThing\n\n-- and will double-check we have them.\n\nLibrary tech topics....\n\nIn the RFID discussion Rob George reminded us that RFID isn't sufficient for security, that most libraries still use magnetic strips for that.  We don't anticipate going to RFID though the self-check and ease of inventory are appealing.\n\nThumbprint (biometric) recognition for check-out with Follett Destiny: Kim Beeman said she has a working installation -- which I look forward to seeing when I get to Bangkok next.  I always envisioned it for primary, but several people warned me that it doesn't work reliably with kids younger than seven or so -- as their fingerprints are too soft? unformed?  Others also mentioned parental concern over storing biometric data of children.\n\nBook Weeks.... listened to others discussing what they do.  What we all do is cram a lot into one week.  Why not make every week \"book week\"?  Spread out more author visits over time, matching the right author to the right age level during the right curriculum time.  World Book Day in April could be the excuse for the whole campus to dress up as a book character.  The UN provides enough days throughout the year to focus on (especially for us as we aren't a nation-based school), e.g., World Literacy Day, Mother Tongue Day, etc.\n\nEngaging readers.... Lots of good ideas and\n\nresources\n\n.\n\nCollection development...\n\nDitto\n\n.\n\nAudiobooks and e-books....  A topic we all have \nopinions about and experiences with, e.g., Shrewsbury has Overdrive, so \nwe were quizzing Kim Beeman.  Many of us have FollettShelf, Bookflix, \nand TumbleBooks.   Barb Philip shared\n\nthe wealth of her experiments\n\nin her primary school library.\n\nStyle of PD.... this small group worked well.  I'm now thinking our network in Singapore (ISLN) should go for one-day Bootcamps designed for no more than 50 participants at a time, on various topics, e.g., on graphic design and signage, copyright, RDA and cataloging, managing genres and the trend to genre-fication, etc. -- for all library staff.\n\nNext year LKSW might be in Bangkok..... ?\n\nPhoto above:  a snapshot of the fabulous biscuits made specially for the conference!",

      "title": "ALA Las Vegas: Take-aways from being with 25k+ librarians for a couple of days",
      "content": "The\n American Library Association's annual conference is a heaving mass of \nlibrarians (of all varieties) in one place for four days - \nFriday-Monday, June 26-30.  Almost any US city is a convenient stopover for me, heading to Maine, at the end of the school year.\n\nThis year ALA was in Las Vegas, a venue that lived up to its stereotype, in the eyes of a first-time visitor. Next year's location - San Francisco - will be more my style perhaps.\n\nBut ALA is always an enriching experience, no matter where it's held.\n\nThe problem is to figure out\n\nwhat\n\nand\n\nwho\n\nyou want to see in the small time and huge space of the event (the exhibition hall alone is worth four days).\n\nYou\n can search offerings and construct your own schedule online ahead of \ntime -- and there is a mobile app -- but the lack of fast/reliable/free \ninternet access (especially Sunday) made that fairly irrelevant.  And \nfor those of us with overseas phone accounts, the smart-phone solution \nfor internet data access wasn't very economical.  So making off-line \nlists and lugging around the fat, physical ALA Guide was a sad, but \ncomforting, necessity.\n\nHere is my public debrief of the conference, filtered through my international, K-12 (primarily middle/high) librarian focus :\n\nPre-Conference: SCHOOL VISITS\n\nThere was a half-day pre-conference event on Friday, visiting three independent (i.e., private) school libraries --\n\nAlexander Dawson School\n\n,\n\nFaith Lutheran Middle and High School\n\n, and\n\nLas Vegas Day School\n\n.  A few photos of each are\n\nhere on Flickr\n\nwith notes below.\n\nAlexander Dawson\n\n:\n\n--\n the librarian pointed out how, in designing the school, no electrical \ncables or wiring is hidden, so kids are very aware of where electricity \nis being used, e.g., for air conditioning, for internet access, etc.;\n\n-- the library had\n\nan \"Aurasma\" wall\n\n-- where we could pick up iPads, scan images, and watch videos the kids had made for one unit of inquiry (e.g., Irish castles);\n\n--\n two authors a year do two-week residencies, including 2 days in each \nclassroom, e.g., Brian Falkner (from NZ) and Paul Owen Lewis -- during which time \neach student creates a book;\n\nFaith Lutheran:\n\n--  had quite a few full-size physical displays, e.g., military uniforms and a skeleton;\n\n--  had\n\nan author/illustrator wall\n\n, where each visiting celebrity's name is added each year;\n\nLV Day School\n\n:\n\n--\n they offer a \"Classic Reader\" program -- where \nstudents read more \"quality\" literature, and then discuss with an adult, four books above and beyond\n their other reading;\n\n-- they run an \"Adopt a Shelf\" program for \nparents -- where parents are responsible for re-shelving and keeping one\n shelf looking tip-top -- they say it's quite competitive!\n\nOverall,\n questions focused on staffing (all were minimally staffed, \nsurprisingly) and what they were doing for ebook provision (e.g., all \nhad Overdrive, despite the fact the local library offers it -- though not sure \nif that affected their choice of titles -- would they try to avoid \noverlap?).\n\nNETWORKING\n\nThis is no small part of ALA.   Many of us \ninternational school librarians managed to find each other (and we are \ndetermined to make it more organized next year).\n\nThe \nfour of us from Singapore (Kim Klein from Stamford American \nInternational School, Kate Brundage from Singapore American School, and \nSusanne Clower and I from United World College of Southeast Asia - East \ncampus) arrived as a nucleus -- and soon found Leanne Mercado from \nNishimachi International School (Tokyo), as well as Candace Aiani and \nBarb Middleton from Taipei American School.  Later we connected with \nLeslie Henry from Jakarta International School and Victoria Robins from \nASF Guadalajara Mexico.  There were others on the list of international \nattendees, but poor connectivity (and our overseas phones) made it hard \nto communicate.  I kick myself that I didn't put out a general call on \nthe social media channels (like the ECIS iSkoodle listserv) beforehand.\n\nDuring the pre-conference session of school visits, while getting on or off the bus, I overheard one woman say \nthe word\"Sakura\" -- and I quickly determined to talk to her at the next stop, \nknowing she must have been referring to the\n\nJapanese international school librarian book award program\n\n, which is how I met Leanne Mercado.  Only when I later I put a face on the name\n \"Barb Middleton\" did I realize that she was on the same Friday school \nlibrary tour, but because her registration tagged identified her as \nbeing from Minnesota, I didn't realize she was one of us - from Taipei \nAmerican School.\n\nThose of us that managed to meet up \ndid our best to \"divide and conquer\" in terms of session attendance.\n\nTO DO:\n\nFinish de-briefing with those who attended this year, especially my Singapore colleagues when we all get back in August;\n\nNext year: advertise on social media for all going to ALA to connect ahead of time;\n\nNext year: maybe have a group of us do a panel presentation on \nInternational School Librarians - as an employment opportunity - pluses \nand minuses, etc.\n\nEBOOKS\n\nA big complaint about\n\nOverdrive for schools\n\nhas been the annual fee -- as much as \nUS$4k/yr in the past.  But at their ALA booth, an Overdrive \nrepresentative confirmed they have recently lowered the cost for school \nlibraries.  Now it is US$1k/yr for up to 999 students and US$2k/yr \nfor up to 1,999 students.  This cost is content \npurchase per annum -- it's not an annual usage fee -- which is great.\n\nFor\n those of us in international schools, a ongoing issue with all ebook \nvendors has been digital rights management (DRM) -- where popular titles\n are often not available to us, being situated outside the countries \nthat are the biggest publishers (USA, UK, Australia, etc.).  I asked the\n Overdrive rep where I could preview the titles actually available to us\n in Singapore -- and she suggested I contact the sales force and get \naccess to a demo overseas account.\n\nStarWalk KidsMedia\n\nis a new ebook vendor -- headed by the famous (and charming) non-fiction author for kids,\n\nSeymour Simon\n\n(and his wife).  500 titles available so far, for grades K-8, half fiction, half non-fiction.  Leveled according to Fountas and \nPinnell.  Only US$895 a year (at least for big schools like ours -- I \nforget if it's cheaper for smaller schools.)  Unlimited, simultaneous \naccess.  Device neutral -- in fact, they assured me that if users \ndownloaded a title (as you have to do to read on a mobile device), the \ntitle will stay accessible on the device for as long as the subscription\n (e.g., a year).  And they will provide MARC records.  It sounds a lot \nlike\n\nBookFlix\n\n--\n but going as high as Grade 8 in interest and complexity.  They were \nhappy to offer us a 1-month free trial -- which I intend to do.\n\nKindle, Kindle, Kindle....?\n\nCandace Aiani (High School) and Barb Middleton (Primary School) have \nembarked wholeheartedly on a Kindle-loaning program at Taipei American \nSchool - and have a wealth of experience.  Back in February she put a \ncall out to the\n\nSILCAsia listserv\n\n, starting a discussion on the management of Kindles in schools - which some of you may have seen.\n\nThey\n organize their Kindles into \"pods\" of 5 devices each -- as each Kindle \naccount can be synced to five devices.  Each Kindle (in a pod) will have\n up to 30 titles or so on it.\n\nClick here to see\n\nwhat a search for \"Kindle\" and \"pod\" turns up in Candace's High School catalog.\n\nClick here to see\n\nwhat\n one Kindle might have on it, e.g., Pod \"I\".  (Now that Kindle Unlimited\n has been launched, I wonder how many of their titles are available to overseas subscribers.)\n\nTaipei American School has gone for Overdrive in a big way --\n\nsee their Overdrive homepage\n\n-- even though the Overdrive books can't be downloaded to overseas \nKindles, they said.  They also aren't thrilled about the fact there is \noften a 6-month delay getting the latest titles into Overdrive.  Note: Barb affirms that FollettShelf is far easier for primary school students to use than Overdrive.\n\nTO DO:\n\nContact sales@overdrive.com and ask for access to a demo overseas \naccount -- now that the Overdrive annual fee is reasonable for school \nlibraries -- for secondary school.\n\nStart 1-month free trial in September of StarWalk KidsMedia -- for primary school.\n\nGAMING / COMPUTING FOR KIDS\n\nJane McGonigal was the opening \nkeynote for ALA -- and didn't disappoint.  She reminded us of all the \npositive emotions gaming releases:  CREATIVITY / CONTENTMENT / AWE + WONDER / EXCITEMENT / CURIOSITY / PRIDE / SURPRISE / LOVE / RELIEF / JOY.\n\n-- not to mention the development of RESILIENCE.\n\nI was glad to be reminded of\n\nher experience developing a game for the New York Public Library\n\nand the quote by Brian Sutton-Smith:\n\n\"The opposite of play isn't work.  It's depression.\"\n\nLater, in the exhibits hall, I ran into\n\nScott Nicholson\n\n,\n professor at the iSchool in Syracuse and expert on gaming -- (I \nattended one of his workshops last year at ALA) -- and was thrilled to \nhear he is due to come to Singapore in November to work with the \nNational Library Board (NLB).  Scott did several sessions at ALA this \nyear -- and is particularly keen on the cognitive benefit of creating \ngames, not just playing them.   Read some of his past papers\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nIn the course of our conversation, he also alerted me to the\n\nMath Fairs\n\nfor students being held annually in Toronto -- which I could definitely see our campus implementing.\n\nThere was also a Poster session on Computational Thinking for Tweens and Teens -- see\n\nhttp://ala14.ala.org/node/14901\n\nwhere you can download the four PDFs.  It's where I came across\n\nCubelets\n\n....\n\nTO DO:\n\nConnect with Scott Nicholson before November -- and with the NLB -- and see if I can organize an\n\nISLN\n\nor school event as well when he is there.\n\nTalk to Tilson Crew, our primary school math coach, to learn more \nabout the math games that she has created and made available in our \nprimary library for borrowing.\n\nTalk to all our math teachers about the possibility of getting a math fair going at our school.\n\nREADING\n\nALA is one big reading-love-fest.  Everyone there is \nfull of book-talk, whether ebook or pbook.  And walking down the aisles \nof the exhibition hall, I just kept snapping photos of book covers, if \nnot picking up free ARCs.  I refuse to fetishize signed editions, making\n it easy to avoid the urge to join any queues in front of author booths \nin the exhibition hall -- though I thoroughly enjoyed the chance to chat\n with authors when given the casual chance, e.g., attending a reception \nwith the author/illustrator Kevin Hawkes who happens to live in Gorham, \nMaine, one town over from my hometown.\n\nDonalyn Miller\n\n, aka The Book Whisperer and Grade 5 teacher extraordinaire, gave a talk on\n\n\"Fostering Positive Reading Identities\"\n\n. \n I was sitting between two international primary school \nteacher-librarians (Leanne Mercado from Tokyo and Barb Middleton from \nTaiwan) and we just kept nodding and laughing as Donalyn enlightened us \nwith her research and entertained us with her personal experiences as a \nreader and reading teacher.\n\nLike\n her, my identity as a reader was clinched in 3rd grade thanks to \"SRA\" \n-- that popular color-coded series of comprehension exercises in a box \n(which introduced me to speed reading as a competitive sport) -- and a \nmemorable teacher, Miss Poole, who not only read \"Charlotte's Web\" to \nus, but also the delightful (though 1950s antiquated) \"Mrs. Piggle \nWiggle\" series of magic solutions.\n\nDonalyn talked about\n the power of reading communities and reiterated the influence of book \n\"commercials\" arising out of the natural community (e.g., peer-to-peer \nrecommendations) -- and the role modeling of being a reader and \nread-alouds -- and all the things we know and have been doing, but need \nto remember are terribly inter-connected and important.\n\nShe\n challenges her students to read 40 or more books a year -- without any \nother reward system.  (Reading is its own reward, as she says.)\n\nShe talked about the intersection of reading interest (\n\nmotivation\n\n), reading level (\n\nability\n\n), and background knowledge (\n\nfertile ground for understanding\n\n) in terms of book choice.  Which makes me think of my beloved Design Thinking intersection of\n\ndesirability\n\n(are you interested in the topic?),\n\nfeasibility\n\n(does it match the assignment?) and\n\nviability\n\n(do we have the resources to support you) -- relating to research questions.\n\nThough\n when it comes to reading levels, she reminded us that lexiles are only \nscaffolds (e.g., Fahrenheit 451 and The Diary of a Wimpy Kid \nhave the same lexile band (true??)) -- and that text complexity is about what is NOT found on the page.\n\nShe recommends having a small pile of \"Special Class Books\" -- ready to hand to any child who says they have no book to read.\n\nI\n like her idea of \"Epicenter Readers\" -- that category of people\n who influence other people's reading, whether in the classroom or in life.  Her own include John Schumacher \n(@mrschureads) and Teri Lesesne (@professornana).  I happened to meet two long-standing online \"Epicenter Readers\" of my own at a Random House reception:  Lynn Rutan and Cindy Dobrez (aka the\n\nBookends\n\nbloggers) -- and gushed over them like a proper groupie.\n\nDonalyn also reiterated the wisdom that less-than-highbrow series helps develop readers.  They are not to be sneered at.  Neither is the habit of re-reading.  As she reminded us, close reading is re-reading with a purpose.\n\nTO DO:\n\nContribute to Donalyn's Nerdy Book club blog\n\nDon't miss her regular Twitter chats, e.g.,\n\n#bproots\n\n- on roots of best practice for literacy teaching\n\nI\n\nNFORMATION LITERACY and THRESHOLD CONCEPTS\n\nThere\n are so many information literacy sessions to attend at ALA, some \nschool-focused, some university-level.   As a high-school \nteacher-librarian, I am often indifferent to that distinction, as much \nof the information literacy instruction is focused on students just entering tertiary education.\n\nA big difference, however, is that \nschool-based librarians are almost all trained teachers, while \nuniversity ones aren't (necessarily).\n\nOne\n flipped university classroom session I attended was a bit of a waste, as it mainly\n extolled the benefits of using curriculum design models in designing \nflipped courses, which any teacher-librarian would already appreciate. \n And I already knew about the handy tools for flipping the classroom \nbeing recommended, e.g., Screencastr, Prezi, Google Docs, etc.\n\nBut\n another session by university librarians teaching information literacy was brilliant in every way -- content, design, and presentation -- \"From Stumbling Blocks to Building Blocks: Using Threshold Concepts to Teach Information Literacy.\"\n\nSee\n\ntheir Powerpoint slides here\n\n.\n\nI’d read\n about threshold concepts, as defined by Meyer and Land \n(academic instruction experts) — and discussed by David Perkins (of \nHarvard fame and general teaching expert), before — but had never read or heard anyone talk about them with specific reference to the field of information literacy, which is what this panel of academic librarians did.\n\nKorey Burnetti, Amy Hofer, and Lori Townsend\n\nreviewed five characteristics of\n\nthreshold concepts:\n\nTransformative\n\n-- they change understanding\n\nIrreversible\n\n— one you get them, you can’t not see them anymore\n\nIntegrative\n\n-- part of a network of interconnected understandings\n\nBounded\n\n— meaning they are usually discipline-specific\n\nTroublesome\n\n— meaning often counter-intuitive\n\nThe metaphor of the threshold refers to the acquisition of these concepts -- which can be compared to crossing a border; a\n mental, liminal space, delimited by time and experience; an extended place where the novice transitions over time to being an expert, with some people getting stuck until they \"get it\" (learning bottlenecks), some roaming around inside indefinitely, perhaps never to emerge.  A lens is a popular metaphor for appreciating the power of threshold concepts in different disciplines - to see with the eyes of an expert.  (The transition from one side to the other also reminds me of the shift from slow thinking to fast thinking (System 1 and System 2) of Daniel Kahnemann et al.)\n\nSlide from the ALA 2014\n\npresentation\n\nThey then discussed some basic information literacy threshold \nconcepts they had distilled as \"enduring understandings,\" using the\n\nWiggins and McTighe model of backward design, for their teaching practice.\n\nFORMAT AS PROCESS\n\nINFORMATION AS COMMODITY\n\nAUTHORITY IS CONSTRUCTED + CONTEXTUAL\n\nMETADATA = FINDABILITY  (aka GOOD SEARCHES  USE DATABASE STRUCTURES)\n\nDATABASE = ORGANIZED COLLECTION\n\nPRIMARY\n SOURCES DEPEND ON PERSPECTIVE\n\nFor example, in exploring FORMAT AS THE RESULT OF A PROCESS, they showed the following typical search results, which to the average student would all look like \"websites\":\n\nSlide from the ALA 2014\n\npresentation\n\nGo read the seminal\n articles by Land + Meyer -- and other\n\nresources available on the wonderful webpage page of the three presenters:\n\nhttp://ilthresholdconcepts.com\n\n.\n\nAnother librarian showed how he promotes some of his library's more unusual digital collections as a means of exploring primary vs. secondary sources with students, e.g., presenting students with an \narchive of 1950s women’s magazines and having them imagine for what \nresearch question would particular advertisements or articles be a \nprimary source.  Showing how questions develop, to a large degree, from the resources being used - in an iterative cycle.\n\nThe mantra they left us with:  READ -- SHARE -- ACT.\n\nMany\n sessions were preceded by awards for best practice.  In the case \nof the Threshold Concepts one, an award was given to\n\nLibrary DIY\n\n(by Meredith Farkas) — a flipped classroom example of teaching \nprocedural (as opposed to conceptual) stuff.  I'd already starred the project in my Diigo bookmarks as something to emulate -- and was thrilled to see it so publicly recognized.\n\nThere was also a poster session on a website called InfoSkills2Go -\n\nhttp://infoskills2go.com/\n\n-- which allows college-bound high school students to earn badges in four categories:  academic integrity, information seeking, information organization, and information evaluation, using\n\nTRAILS\n\nas the pre-test and post-test.\n\nAnother poster session I missed was -- \"\n\nStudent to Superhero: Freshmen Tell Their Research Stories\n\n\" -- see\n\nhttp://bit.ly/studentsuperhero\n\n-- where they described how they had students create a graphical narrative using the software called\n\nComic Life\n\nto reflect on their entry-level university information literacy course.\n\nTO DO:\n\nRe-think my own teaching modules with these info lit threshold concepts in mind\n\nLook at the InfoSkills2Go website\n\nDISCOVERY (AND FAST CATALOGING)\n\nThere\n is a tension between the Google single box search — and the box (or boxes) we provide as windows into our local information resources.  Between what is out there in the largest sense of the world and what we can actually deliver (from our physical collection and our various virtual ones).\n\nCandace\n (of the Taipei American School) told me she has recently implemented \nthe\n\nEBSCO discovery layer\n\n.  I didn’t get a chance to really get into \nthis with her (which is why I am determined to get up to Taipei to spend\n concentrated time absorbing her school’s information environment and \nhow she is tackling these common problems of ours).\n\nIn\n terms of our library catalogs — Follett Destiny, for both Candace and \nme — the new Universal Search interface is an improvement (e.g., useful filtering via the sidebar).  But it's still slow and cumbersome compared to Google.\n\nShould we still be trying to steer students to our catalog?  What if we the library just focused on delivery of what students find elsewhere?  Leave the catalog there as our best inventory tool and perfect Subject Headings for our own discovery purposes, but not expect students to desert their best-friend Google?\n\n(NB: I've been heavily influenced by the thoughts of Aaron Tay (an academic librarian in Singapore) -- see this\n\nSept 2013 blog post\n\nof his and his ongoing\n\nFlipboard magazine on Web scale search and discovery systems\n\n.)\n\nTraditionally (think: paper card \ncatalogs) findability has depended upon controlled Subject Headings (e.g., \nLibrary of Congress (LCSH)), where each item would have no more than six\n \nhighly-faceted subjects\n\n(e.g.,  Indonesia - Relations - China - History)\n\n.  Nowadays, with \nfull-text searching and unlimited tags possible, controlled vocabularies are less important -- at least to users.\n\nThe single search box -- allowing for multiple fields and combination of terms to be searched at once -- demands a re-think of subject headings.  Which is why I've been following the FAST cataloging project for years -- and chose to attend the Faceted Subject Access Interest Group sessions at ALA this year.\n\nFAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology)\n\nAs much as RDA(1) is\n about moving bibliographic metadata forward, FAST cataloging is the cutting edge of subject heading progress.  Which is perhaps why it was standing room only in this session where Cornell University librarians (one of whom is a Discovery Metadata Librarian by title) relayed their experience as \nguinea pigs converting their data from LCSH to FAST — in collaboration \nwith OCLC Research (who were also in the room).  They're hoping to go live on July 1st.  (See\n\ntheir Powerpoint slides here\n\n.)\n\nA lot of the technical stuff was beyond me -- and the scale difference \nbetween Cornell’s converting their holdings and a school library like mine are enormous.\n\nBut I still got a lot out of the session -- and think we should be moving to FAST subject headings instead of Sears/LCSH.\n\nFacets can be in eight categories:  Personal names, Corporate names, Geographic names, Events, Titles, Time periods, Topics, and Form/Genre.\n\nThe FAST mindset was described as:\n\nUse what you find\n\nSubjects do not cross facets, e.g., you can't have \"Italy - History\"\n\nObserve difference between topical and genre/form facets\n\nFewer application rules, e.g., the order of headings is not significant, no constraints on combinations of topical and geographic terms\n\nDates can be whatever you need to assign, e.g., \"1992-2011\" is fine if that's what the resource covers\n\nThe elephant in the room, they admitted, is that, if FAST is so great, why isn't everyone rushing to use it?  Will it replace LCSH?  Only time will tell.\n\nWatch this space.\n\nLinks re FAST:\n\nALCTS: FAST for cataloging and discovery\n\n- newsletter\n\nOCLC FAST Research page\n\nsearchFAST\n\nOCLC Classify tool\n\n--\n\nto get suggested FAST headings for a book\n\nCornell Library FAST webpage\n\nLIBRARY DESIGN\n\nLibrary design is of on-going interest, no matter that my library is theoretically all built now.  I went to a session on\n\n“Science + Form = Function: The Impact of Neuroscience on Architecture and Design”\n\n-- a subject for which is there is an Academy -- see\n\nhttp://www.anfarch.org/\n\nand especially their recommended reading list:\n\nhttp://www.anfarch.org/recommended-reading/\n\n.\n\nThe session opened with a quote from Winston Churchill who said, \"We shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us.\"\n\nThe speakers talked about the\n\nten\n\nsenses:  touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight.... plus\n\npressure\n\n,\n\nbalance\n\n,\n\ntemperature\n\n,\n\nmotion\n\n, and\n\npain\n\n.\n\nImagine a grid where these ten senses are the y-axis.  Then put these\n\nlibrary space functions\n\nacross the x-axis:\n\nassembly\n\n,\n\ncontemplation\n\n,\n\ndata collection\n\n,\n\npresentation\n\n,\n\nreading\n\n,\n\nrefuge\n\n,\n\nretreat\n\n,\n\nstorage\n\n,\n\nstudying\n\n, and\n\nteaching\n\n.  Consider the intersection of each -- and decide priorities and possibilities.\n\nWe need to consider the intersection of three things:  Behavior, Experience, and Brain Activity in a space like a library.\n\nSpeakers talked of Inspiration, Trust, and Empathy, as well as Symbolism, Wayfinding, and Exploration -- linking hand, brain, and symbol.  They asked us to consider what Affordances the library provides, to invite or indicate desired actions -- and the tension between Function and Representation (symbolism) in our spaces.\n\nFrankly, I didn't get any practical inspirations from the session, but felt mentally stretched from sitting through it.\n\nMeanwhile some other teacher-librarian\n went to a discussion meeting (one of those smaller things in the \nschedule that you could miss in the blink of an eye, unless you were \nobservant) on The Information Commons.  Of all the things I was listening for \nin her brief summary in the time we had for debrief, I latched onto her \nreporting of someone who had “pink things hanging from the ceiling” that\n absorbed sound.  The ALA notes on this meeting also mention \"pink noise machines\" (\n\nsee here\n\n). I am now searching for this mysterious product/item.  \n(Contact me if you can help!)  (Could the person have been talking about \"pink noise\" - in contrast to \"white noise\" --\n\nsee distinction here\n\n-- instead of something literally pink?)\n\nAcoustics is my ongoing elephant in the room and I am on the lookout for all \nameliorating accessories.  (Over the summer there are ceiling/wall \npanels being installed in my library — wish I had done my \npre-installation research benchmarks and logged some decibel stats….)\n\nThere was a poster session I really wanted to attend, but missed --\n\nLibrarian Design Share: Inspiration for Library Creatives\n\n.  On the other hand, the beauty of the best poster sessions is that the poster itself is posted online and tells it all -- see\n\nhttp://ala14.ala.org/files/ala14/LibDS-ALA-Poster-FINAL.pdf\n\n-- and their website --\n\nhttp://librariandesignshare.org/\n\n-- is a treasure-trove.  The session description mentions they would be giving visitors \"design strategy cards\" -- I wonder if they pointed people to\n\nthe \"Design with Intent\" toolkit\n\n, which I love.\n\nAnother poster session I missed was\n\n\"Gearing Up for College\"\n\n-- about university libraries reaching out to low-income middle school children who excel in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) fields.  Interestingly, they used a map activity to get the students to observe what was going on in the university library -- and hopefully to get interested in what they were observing.  (Reminds me of the ALA program session I attended last year -- where Andrew Asher described having students create color-timed cognitive maps of the library -- see\n\nhttp://www.andrewasher.net/BiblioEthnoHistorioGraphy/category/mapping/\n\n.  A fascinating way to make the virtual visible.... )\n\nTO DO:\n\nTrack down \"pink noise things\"\n\nContribute to\n\nhttp://librariandesignshare.org/\n\nMakerspaces\n\nMakerspaces is definitely still a hot topic for libraries.  I did a full-day pre-conference last year at ALA on them, and knew I was going to a four-day\n\n\"Constructing Modern Knowledge\"\n\nsummer institute in New Hampshire, July 8-11, which would be completely about making things (watch for another blog post eventually), so I didn't bother to attend maker-related sessions at ALA.\n\nAs my school already has an extensive Design and Technology department and set-up (with 3D printers, laser cutters, et al.), I'm thinking the library should focus on making to do with books -- like setting up a Writing Center (a project several of us have been trying to get off the ground for three years now) and promoting Book Art.\n\nOne poster session was about an annual RE:BOOK altered book contest -- at the Claremont College Libraries.\n\nSee the PDF here\n\n.  What a great way to re-purpose donated books -- of which I have plenty.\n\nTO DO:\n\nConnect with the art teachers and get some regular altered book art going -- perhaps with a permanent book art workspace in a corner of the library -- or up on the Art Floor.  I like the idea of an annual contest.\n\nPDA (Patron Driven Acquisition)\n\nWhen I hear \"PDA,\" I still think of \"public display of affection\" -- something every high school librarian deals with every day.  But it's the latest term for users letting us know what they want (starting from that good 'ole book suggestion form) -- and it goes hand-in-hand with a good collection policy.\n\nThere were several small sessions on PDA as it relates to e-book and video purchases, e.g., see\n\nhere\n\n,\n\nhere\n\n, and\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nCandace was telling me how she has instituted an online ticketing system for all library requests -- whether book purchase recommendations or queries about database passwords, etc.  I forget the name of the software package she said she bought, but it is one where people can search the database, to see the status of their problem or request.  Our Facilities and IT Depts both use a basic ticketing system, but we users don't have the ability to search their records.  Must look into it for our library.  I know there are requests that fall off my radar.....\n\nThe Latest and the Greatest: ARCs and Awards\n\nFor school librarians, there are two important annual lists that get announced at ALA.\n\nBest Apps for Teaching and Learning\n\nBest Websites for Teaching and Learning\n\nALA is also a place to pick up Advanced Reader Copies of books.  I try not to go crazy.\n\nHere are a few I picked up:\n\nJared Diamond's \"The Third Chimpanzee\" - Young Readers edition\n\nFrank Einstein and the Anti-matter Motor - by Jon Scieszka\n\nHold Tight, Don't Let Go - by Laura Rose Wagner - a YA novel re Haiti and the earthquak\n\nVango - by Timothee de Fombelle\n\nImaginary - by A.F. Harrold, illustrated by Emily Gravett\n\nThere Will Be Lies - by Nick Lake\n\nYoung Houdini - by SImon Nicholson\n\nThe Wollstonecraft Detective Agency - by Jordan Stratford\n\nOn a Clear Day - by Walter Dean Myters\n\nA Path Appears - by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl Wu\n\nNotes:\n\nLast\n year at ALA I did a full-day pre-conference on RDA (Resource \nDescription + Access).  What I immediately love about RDA is its simple hierarchy, distinguishing between Work, \nExpression, Manifestation, Item (WEMI), not to mention its elaboration of \ndates — so one can distinguish between work creation date, original \npublication date, particular edition date, and manufacture date.\n\nPhotos:\n\nSRA:\n\nhttp://allaboutthe1970s.blogspot.com/2010/04/i-remember-those.html",

I can't believe...  -- the inspiration - the imaginarium\n\nConstruct\n\n-- hands-on -- the atelier -- immersion and innovation\n\nContemplate\n\n-- heads-in -- mindfulness -- the sanctuary or secret garden\n\nCast\n\n-- play-back -- re-visit -- stage -- dramatize -- experiment\n\nCon-vivire\n\n-- the sharing -- the piazza -- the agora -- expressivity\n\nShe stressed these are just guidelines for what happens along the way in different ways -- that the stages should never be used prescriptively.\n\nOur school is just settling on some common terminology around\n\na research model\n\n-- one that will be differentiated for Infant (K1 to Grade 1), Junior (Grade 2 to Grade 5), Middle School (Grade 6 to Grade 8) and High School (Grade 9 to Grade 12).\n\nA midway meeting ground has been agreed, e.g., here is a standard arising out of the articulation of the middle school curriculum:\n\nThe blog \"What Ed Said\" (Edna Sackson) recently had a post\n\non her frustration with expected slavish commitment to an inquiry cycle  model.  I agree.  You might as well insist everyone follow the same  sequence for falling in love or grieving over death.  It's useful to  appreciate typical stages, but impossible to expect everyone to adhere  to them.  NB:  Kath Murdoch, referenced by Edna, is a frequent professional visitor to our school, and\n\nher phases of inquiry\n\nwere key inputs to our process -- see here:\n\nEdith was talking about\n\nPlay\n\n-- and undoubtedly about\n\nInquiry\n\n.  But our school is talking about\n\nResearch\n\n.  Are they all the same thing?  Just at different age levels?  We'd like to think so.\n\nResearch, for middle/high school students, is just a game with adult rules (e.g., alluding to the ideas of others in a constructive and respectful way) -- and our job is to alert them to those rules and to convince them it's a game worth learning (after all, research is a form of adult fun, yes?).  As Edith put it, students must learn to add value in the process of borrowing.   They must become adept at massaging ideas until they are their own, rather than just functioning as an information broker, passing on ideas.  To ride others' ideas until they can feel in solo mode, not fusion mode.\n\nI particularly like Edith's \"Cast\" phase, with its implicit theatrical connotation.  Something between our \"Reflect\" and \"Communicate.\"  It's the part that implies the iterative nature of the process.  That you, within your own mind or in the presence of others, re-think what you have, try it out, and ask if it's sufficient, if it's enough.\n\n(I'm also partial to Design Thinking as a basic research model; see my previous blog post:\n\nCarol Kuhlthau Meets Tim Brown\n\n. )\n\nOther things Edith commented upon....\n\nre MOOCs and online learning:\n\nthe double standard:  it's the new entrepreneurial elite, who are educated onsite with constructivist methods, who are promoting education online where \"others\" struggle alone;\n\nre today's learners:\n\ngrowing older younger, and staying younger older;\n\nthe tension between temp and \"forever\" work\n\nthe tension between professional mobility and lack of security;\n\nre the role of the eye and the senses:\n\naway from Piaget (the rationalist) to Papert (feeling the materials);\n\nthe real practitioners (e.g., architects) are always tricking people to get a different perspective;\n\nto crawl out of the old ways of thinking;\n\ntricks to get us off our own beaten path;\n\nusing objects creates resistance;\n\n\"Learning is all about moving in and out of focus, shifting perspective, and coming to 'see anew.'\" -- Edith Ackermann",

      "content": "Gary Stager\n\nand\n\nSylvia Martinez\n\nhave been holding a very special 4-day summer institute in New Hampshire for the past 7 years.\n\n\"\n\nConstructing Modern Knowledge\n\n\" (\n\n#CMK14\n\n) provides teachers with a learning space and enough time to the fail -- and succeed -- at doing what we are always exhorting our students to do:  learn something!  make something!\n\nI got involved by virtue of having put Stager and Martinez's book --\n\n\"Invent to Learn: making, tinkering, and engineering in the classroom\"\n\n-- on display in my library to coincide with the\n\nLearning 2.0\n\nconference last October (see my\n\nprevious blog post\n\non it).\n\nBrian Smith\n\n(from Hong Kong International School) immediately began to talk to me about the book -- and the related conference.  Considering I spend my summers in Maine (a stone's throw away), it wasn't hard to decide to sign up.  At\n\n21st Century Learning\n\nin HK in December, I also had the opportunity to meet Gary, who exudes enthusiasm for messy learning and hard fun.\n\n4 days, 180 participants.  You can see\n\nthe Vimeo videos here\n\nand\n\nthe Flickr group photos here\n\n.  All in a Radisson Hotel in ManchVegas.  (Yes, I guess that's what they call Manchester, NH -- as it's the region's hotspot.)\n\nWho were we?  The informal hands-up survey at the beginning indicated mainly teachers from private schools, from all over the US, plus a few internationals.  I quickly found\n\nTina Photakis\n\n, from Australia, to hang out with.  The crowd was seeded with plenty of highlighted helpers, like\n\nBrian Smith\n\n(and his daughter), young\n\nSuper-awesome Sylvia\n\nTodd (and her father),\n\nPeggy Sheehy\n\n(one of the few librarians),\n\nDan and Molly Watt\n\n,\n\nCynthia Solomon\n\n, etc.\n\nHow did we decide what we were going to build in our 4 days?  By shouting out suggestions that got put on giant post-it notes on the wall, followed by a massive gallery walk and sign-up.  Then we gathered by our top favorite post-it -- and groups were formed.  It worked admirably, better than most unconference events I've experienced.  I loved the range of ideas:  a light-sensitive chicken coop, a robot \ndog, an interactive recycling bin,  an interactive tree, an interactive \ngarden, interactive clothing, etc.\n\nOne proposed project was \"wearable speakers\" -- and having attended two \nconferences this summer, I wish there were a smart-phone app for that right now.   How can\n it be that we don't have a way to make ourselves heard in big groups, e.g., questions from the floor, where no one can hear the question.\n\nI wanted to work on a noise meter of sorts, as I'd had a Design and Technology IB student create a (unfortunately non-working) prototype for my library, using an\n\nArduino\n\n.  So I knew I wanted to play with sound input creating some sort of visual output.  (Imagine: students in a supposedly silent study room with windows, where I am outside and can't tell how much noise they are actually making; when decibels go above a certain level,  colored lights began to flash -- indicating to both them and me that the room is no longer silent.)\n\nIn the end, I went with a group interested in \"sound sculpture\", which eventually split into three or four smaller groups.\n\nGordon\n\n,\n\nWendy\n\n, and I decided to see how we could get sound through an Arduino to display different colors, based on volume and frequency.  Gordon and Wendy wired the 3D matrix of lights, while I fooled around with programming an Arduino Esplora (a device which can take a variety of input).  We didn't get a fully-functioning integrated model, due to time and other limitations, but we sure learned a lot.  For me it was such a throw-back to my programming days.  Oh, the frustrations of imperfect code!\n\nA major highlight of the conference was a field trip to the fabled\n\nMIT Media Lab\n\n, thanks to Gary and Sylvia's connections.   A talk by Mitch Resnick, founder of the\n\nLifelong Kindergarten\n\ngroup.  (\n\nHere's a recent video of him doing a talk\n\nthat is similar to the one we heard - on Projects, Peers, Passion, and Play.)  A chat with 87-year-old\n\nMarvin Minsky\n\n, one of the three pioneers immortalized in the lobby of the impressive building, the other two being\n\nSeymour Papert\n\n(represented at CMK14 by his daughter, Artemis, and granddaughter), and\n\nMuriel Cooper, who died 20 years ago\n\n.\n\nMarvin regaled us with memories of his time at Bell Labs with Claude Shannon.  Re his artificial arm.  Though he lamented that no one wants to work -- nowadays -- on something so pedestrian as a former invention.  So no improvements are forthcoming.  He talked about being enthralled by nanotechnology.  The wave of the future.   He talked of computer games, and his belief that 4 year olds might play games, but 5 year olds should be moving on to making games.   His advice when getting stuck in life?  Ask the experts.  Which for him were Claude Shannon and Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nWe took advantage of the chance to wander down through the building.  So many windows into projects and the learning going on.  It was a wonderful evening in Cambridge/Boston.\n\nClick here to see all my photos\n\nof the conference -- including plenty taken inside the Media Lab.\n\nBack in Manchester, there was plenty of time for work, for reflection, and for inspiration from speakers interspersed in the schedule.\n\nEdith Ackermann\n\n, an MIT stalwart and \"play\" expert, gave a fascinating presentation.  She talked of so many things -- she deserves a separate blog post.\n\nPete Nelson\n\nis famous for building treehouses.  I didn't know about him before, but now I appreciate he has his own reality\n\nTV show, Treehouse Masters\n\nand\n\na treehouse center\n\nwhere you can go and stay.\n\nHe told the story of how his childhood passion for treehouses eventually led to a very public and remunerative vocation.  (Creating a coffee table book on treehouses of the world was an important first step!)  I'm sure most of us sitting there were thinking of old trees we wanted to create houses in.  He made it sound all so feasible.\n\nOverall take-away thoughts:\n\nRe the sharing of resources:  the organizers had an incredible array of materials available to us, but the trick was, whatever we took, we needed for the four days.  There wasn't much that you just needed short-term access to.  So the sharing was limited.  I wondered how libraries with a makerspace would cope with this.  Would someone be able to check out or reserve, say, an Arduino Esplora, for three days?  What is realistic for what time period of exclusive use?  It makes me think that individual hardware, such as Raspberry Pi's and Arduinos, is better suited to a teacher-class situation, where a learner can work with one set of materials over time.\n\nHow best to handle differentiation?  In this situation, some of us at a table had NO experience, and some had CONSIDERABLE.   I was conscious of trying to balance the time I spent floundering on my own and the time I spent getting help from others.  One thing for sure: we were in charge of our own learning.  It was fascinating to wander around, seeing the vast range of projects and skills on display.\n\nCMK library:  There was a room at the conference where Gary and Sylvia laid out all their personal collection of books related to making and creating.  I took photos of most of them -- and have searched Amazon, making a \"list\" of them.  See the\n\nbooklist\n\nhere:\n\nThe Maker Movement and Constructing Modern Knowledge\n\n.\n\nAlso\n\nsee this Reggio Emilia bookshop\n\nfor more.\n\np.s.  Just discovered Gary and Sylvia maintain their own recommended booklist on Amazon --\n\nsee here\n\n.\n\np.p.s.  Here's\n\nanother related booklist\n\n-- one from the\n\nInternational Design Technology teachers' conference\n\n, held at our school in May.  These were all the books I had on display during the conference.",

      "content": "A couple of days ago, someone on the US-based\n\nYALSA-BK listserv\n\n(yes, listservs are still active in many arenas -- even though other social media tools have arisen) suggested we crowd-source (amongst ourselves) lists of titles for MS/HS \"themed\" book talks.\n\nI'd been wanting to promote such lists to my students, but struggled to find a way to make the production process scaleable.  How to keep track of the books I booktalked as a themed grouping and continually promote the list.\n\nA few years back\n\nThe ReadAdventurer blog\n\npublished some \"walls of books\" -- see \"\n\n140+ Books for the Boys of YA\n\n\", \"\n\n120 YA books from the UK\n\n\", \"\n\n110+ Australian YA books\n\n\", and \"\n\nA Metric Ton of Short YA Books\n\n\" -- which I loved.  Then there were the online readers advisory tools like the\n\nNPR Book Concierge\n\n, which also shared booklists using book covers in a very visual way.  I wanted to find some vehicle to do the same thing -- generate lists based on themes -- but be visible in the library all the time.\n\nThen I found\n\n+Rebecca Dunham\n\n(blog -\n\nLunashee's Lunac\n\ny) and\n\nher YA themed posters\n\n(freely given away under Creative Commons).   Her posters inspired us to create our own, by providing some initial themes and a basic style to copy.  As we didn't have all the books on her posters, we simply modified the selection of titles to match our collection.\n\nLuckily I have a teacher, Mairin Raisdana, who works part-time in our library as our design and production queen; I just come up with the themes and titles I want to potentially booktalk.\n\nHere is\n\na Google Plus photo album of our posters\n\n, so far:\n\nAn important feature of every poster is both a QR code and a shortened URL (goo.gl or bit.ly) which takes viewers directly to the booklist in our Follett Destiny catalog.  So people can find out whether any copies are currently available in the library or not.  A majority of our high school students do have smart phones, but I also have a number of iPads that can be used as mobile OPACS and QR code scanners.\n\nBy linking to the catalog -- to a Resource List or to a search for particular key words or subject headings -- I can booktalk the books shown on the poster, but know there is a ready list of those books plus more -- to put into students' hands.  (Nothing worse than booktalking a stack of titles and not having enough to go around....)\n\nThe poster images are also available in our Libguides -- on a\n\nHigh School Reading Recommendations\n\nguide -- linking back to our catalog.\n\nPhysical copies of the poster are very important.  There's just so much in our libraries that is hidden online (or in our heads).\n\nIn the library itself wall space is limited.  So instead, we've got a circular rack of A3 (11\" x 17\") posters in plastic -- allowing patrons to browse the posters, like they would clothing.  The photos of our poster carousel are at the end of the slideshow above.  I've thought eventually I could get dividers on the rack, the equivalent of \"Size 8\", \"Size 10\", etc. -- \"Teacher Favorites\", \"HS Genres\", \"MS Genres\", \"Fiction\", \"Nonfiction\", etc.\n\nNote that the hanging posters are not laminated.  (Bad for the environment....) Instead they are put in re-usable stiff plastic sleeves.  This allows for easy updating of the display.  In the slideshow I include some pictures of what I buy here in Singapore, where they are called \"card cases\" or \"hard cases\".  I'm not sure what they would be called elsewhere (\"document cases\"?).  The coat/skirt hangers are from IKEA.\n\nOur school has a big Epson printer -- that allows us to produce posters \nthat are 1.x meters (3 feet+) in size.  So we can also put big-scale posters \nin hallways and on teachers' walls.  (As we encourage all teachers to \ngive us their list of favorite books -- from which we create a poster \nfor them.\n\nSee this previous blog post\n\n.)",

The difference is glaringly obvious.\n\nYes, the power of blogs is in the collaborative story.\n\nFrom another business blog, another posting (\n\nNaked Conversations: Story Telling v. Product Selling\n\n) comes this comment about speakers at conferences and how the best ones tell stories:\n\nMalcolm Gladwell was our favorite last year.  He was selling his book, but he didn't talk much about his book.\n\nA case of showing what a good storyteller he was, rather than telling people he was.

They're wonderful snippets of thought relating to del.icio.us, RSS, and tagging (as well as more techie concerns).\n\nHere are the bits that made me either nod my head in approval or mentally tag for more consideration:\n\nWhen you chose what to build, solve a problem you have yourself so you can be\n\nsure to understand it. Passion counts.\n\nAggregation is often a focus of attention (latest, most active, etc.)\n\nAs the population gets larger, the bias drifts; del.icio.us/popular becomes\n\nless interesting to the original community members. Work out ways to let the\n\nsystem fragment in to different areas of attention.\n\nTagging is mostly user interface - a way for people to recall things, what\n\nthey were thinking about when they saved it. Fairly useful for recall, OK for\n\ndiscovery, terrible for distribution (where publishers add as many tags as\n\npossible to get it in lots of boxes).\n\nAutomatic tags lose a lot - doesn't help the user really achieve their goals.\n\nThat's why the \"add to del.icio.us\" badges don't let you suggest tags.\n\nValue in Delicious is in the \"attention\" - auto-tagging detracts from this.\n\nMake users do the minimum amount of work. But make them do something.\n\nYou have to speak the user's language. \"Bookmarks\" are what you call them if\n\nyou use Netscape of Firefox - most users these days know the term \"favourite\"\n\ninstead. Half of his population (? users) didn't know what a bookmark was.\n\nAnd here's a line that made me -- as a librarian -- stop and stare:\n\n\"Beware librarians\" - some people want to give tags a specific, underlying\n\nmeaning. Don't let them.\n\nCome on...\n\nAnyway, his comment re tagging as most useful for recall -- for the person who tagged it -- reminded me of Roger Schank's\n\n\"Tell Me A Story: Narrative and Intelligence\"\n\n(1990), a book I keep returning to in thinking about tagging as well as cataloging (yes, the librarian kind).\n\nHere's an excerpt from the foreword by Gary Saul Morson, summarizing Schank's argument:\n\n\"What enables ... people to respond\n\nintelligently\n\n?  The answer, for Schank, is that they have previously mulled over their experiences and\n\nlabeled\n\nthem in multiple interesting ways.  From a sequence of experiences they have constructed a narrative; they have reflected on this narrative and found a number of ways in which it is significant; and in so doing, their memory has attached several labels to the story, which allow them to recall the story when another narrative suggests similar labels.  Once the earlier story is recalled, these people can reflect on pertinent comparisons with the current situation.  Present wisdom depends on earlier indexing.\n\nIn effect, then the real moment of intelligence occurs\n\nnot\n\n(or not only) when one is reminded of the pertinent story, but when the pertinent story was stored in memory.  Intelligence occurs\n\nearlier\n\n.  It is closely related to good indexing.\"\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\ntags\n\n,\n\ntagging\n\n,\n\nattention_economy\n\n,\n\nlibrarian\n\n,\n\nSchank",

      "content": "Refreshing report in the Guardian (UK) --\n\n\"Another Hard Day in the Library\"\n\n-- earlier this month from Germaine Greer and other academics about how they really spent their university days and the long-term benefits of NOT forcing students to attend lectures and tutorials (as Oxford is threatening to do via contracts with the students).\n\nI always felt college was mainly four interesting walls within which to grow for four years. Greer says it better:\n\nKids don't go to university to sit at the feet of their elders and betters; they go to university to meet each other.... Because this is what uni is, the first time young people have their own collective space to organise or disorganise as they please.... Dragooning undergraduates would be to delay their maturation still further, so that they never achieve the autonomy on which our whole political system should be based.\n\nMade me think about the importance of young people having \"their own collective space\" online to \"organise or disorganise as they please\" -- and the need for human attention structures.   Lanham in his article on general education in the digital age (see yesterday's posting) makes the point that \"considered on the largest scale, the undergraduate curriculum is an attention-structure.\"\n\nGreer also argues that incompetent teachers are often far more valuable than good ones -- because they make you react to their incompetence -- and hence move you further along towards your own competence.\n\n\"Surely not!\" is a more salutary reaction to a statement from a teacher than \"Precisely\". As I used to say to my students, \"\n\nConfusion is the most productive state of mind. Respect your confusions. Don't let me waft them away\n\n.\"\n\nCarol Kuhlthau\n\nwould surely agree.\n\nGreer also makes a case for lectures being replaced by digital multimedia versions:\n\nIn 2006, it would make more sense to issue the lectures on DVD, and spend the hour in the lecture room dealing with student's questions.  In my day, students were supposed to be critical listeners.... The very best teacher is the one who really enjoys being made to look a fool by a student.\n\nLectures are a misshapen survival of medieval pedagogy, which took authority  as absolute and understood the teacher's sole duty to be that of expounding it.  Lectures have no place in a system based on critical thinking....\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\ninformation literacy\n\n,\n\nuniversity\n\n,\n\nteaching",

I started thinking about mini research projects of my own in my new job come August, e.g., establishing baseline surveys of kids' knowledge and levels of multi-literacies in order to track just what added value a teacher librarian can provide (especially as the school doesn't have one at the moment) and the positive difference created by collaboration...\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\ninformation literacy\n\n,\n\nevidence-based practice\n\n,\n\nEARCOS\n\n,\n\nconferences\n\n,\n\nschool librarians\n\n,\n\nguided inquiry",

The farmer called each of his stacked enterprises\n\na \"holon\"\n\n, a word (Pollan explains) originating with\n\nArthur Koestler\n\nand meaning an entity that is both self-contained and a dependent part of a bigger system.\n\nFor example, one holon on his farm is to have cows graze a new pasture every day, with another holon being to have chickens feed in that same field three days later in order to eat the larvae just hatched in the cowpats.  The farmer described himself as the orchestra conductor, \"making sure everybody's in the right place at the right time\".\n\nI'd like to think of the school library as a holon -- just as every primary school classroom and the other specialist lessons are holons -- each self-contained and yet part of an interrelated system, with collaboration and communication between teachers and teacher-librarians necessary to make sure that the flow of intellectual nutrition is gathered at exactly the best moment.\n\nSo who's the orchestra conductor?

His narrative of how he explores that question is an excellent model of inquiry-based learning -- in adults, in the real world, on a topic that definitely addresses the big 'so what?' criterium.\n\nDid you know that food production burns almost 1/5 of the petroleum consumed in the US?  Just as much as cars consume... \"And how could it come to pass that a fast-food burger produced from corn and fossil actually costs less than a burger produced from grass and sunlight?\"  By the way, his website provides access to all of his articles over the years, many of which contain ideas pulled together in this book.\n\nI would love to see such a book re-written for upper primary and middle school students (much like\n\nEric Schlosser\n\ntook his\n\nFast Food Nation\n\nand re-wrote it as\n\nChew on This\n\nwith Charles Wilson -- not to mention\n\nthe movie\n\njust coming out).\n\nPollan tunes in, finds out, sorts out, goes further, make conclusions, takes action, and then shares and reflects -- in continual loops (to use\n\nKath Murdoch's model\n\nof inquiry -- though any one could be used, e.g.,\n\nthe Big6\n\n,\n\nPLUS\n\n, etc.) -- about food chains, a topic included in many curricula.\n\nHaving kids see that adults get excited about big questions and pursue them is so important.   Unfortunately, I haven't seen all that many primary school teachers who are committed to inquiry projects of their own -- or perhaps I should say I haven't seen many teachers share their outside passions within the school.   Perhaps in my new school come August I'll provide display space in the library for teachers to do just that -- share their reading interests and personal ongoing inquiries.\n\nTags:\n\neducation\n\n,\n\ninquiry_based_learning\n\n,\n\nfood",

      "content": "In my school library I put different quotes related to reading and books on shelfmarkers, hoping the kids will stop to read and think as they browse.  Late Friday afternoon a 5th grade girl caught me as I was rushing from one task to another and said, \"Did you make those shelfmarkers?\"  \"Yes,\" I said and started to move away.  \"But, what about this one that says 'Stories can save your life'?\" she continued, \"How can that be true?\"  I stopped.  My brain was really on something else and I searched for the simplest answer.  \"Well, of course they can.  Maybe you read a novel about survival and you learn something that later helps you survive. And think of all the non-fiction books that have important information in them.\"  The look on her face told me she wasn't completely convinced, but I moved on, even though I knew I hadn't handled the moment well at all.\n\nThen today I happened to read\n\nJudith Ridge's article in the March 2006 issue of the Horn Book\n\non the books of Boori Monti Pryor, an Aboriginal, and his white partner, Meme McDonald, in which the power of that quote in the context of Aboriginal storytelling was addressed.\n\nIt’s a fascinating concept of story — that what is most powerful lies in what cannot be said. The experience made Meme realize that “stories are our lifeblood — they instruct us how to live and how to be and what visions to hold true. They’re fundamental to the happiness of our lives, so they’re very precious. So in that sense, I think if you start to regard stories as an absolute essential of life, rather than a distraction from life, then how you evolve them and in what context, what respect you have for the source of that story, becomes very important whatever culture you come from.”\n\nThe point of all of this, of course, is that this new — or, rather, most ancient — way of creating stories isn’t just an issue for Aboriginal people. In fact, it’s not even just about story — it’s about life and culture and creating a society based on principles of respect and collaboration.\n\nAs for the quote, \"Stories can save your life\", one frequently cited source for it is\n\nTim O'Brien\n\n's book \"The Things They Carried\", though of course Sharhazad in \"1001 Arabian Nights\" is the best example, as\n\nSusan Fletcher\n\ndiscusses on her website in connection with her book \"Shadow Spinner\".\n\nI can't wait to get back to school and find that girl again.

They start by scanning an entire set of (hardcopy) periodicals in a library, no matter what field they are in (e.g., engineers are instructed to not overlook Women's Wear Daily or Art in America), looking for patterns of themes or topics relating to change and new innovations.   Then they move onto online resources (and she provides a good list), again, across a wide range of interests.\n\nThis type of scanning outside one's forte is exactly what I think all those involved in education should always be doing.\n\nI particularly like her recommendation:  \"Another strategy is identifying the websites of the literate lunatic fringe -- or genius fringe -- and monitoring their blogs (weblogs).\"\n\nYes, checking out the edge is always interesting.

As for handouts to download, the IB ones are listed on the conference website given above, but for the EARCOS ones you have to drill down into the sub-pages, e.g., the\n\nWorkshop Presenters\n\npage, and look under each name.]\n\nI'm writing up my notes\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n\n, but the focal point of both experiences was\n\non the form and content of the future that educators, in particular, need to start acting upon\n\n-- and each conference provided an excellent guru.\n\nTechnology\n\nis obviously the form, but while anyone can get up and rant about exponential growth and the need to embrace change, not just anyone can show us workable paths and original thinking.\n\nAt the IBAP conference,\n\nStephen Heppell\n\n(check out\n\nhis bio\n\n, if you've never heard of him) pulled up example after example from his crowded Mac desktop screen showing us how he's involved in getting students and teachers to learn collaboratively using the latest technology (see\n\nnotschool.net\n\n,\n\nteachers.tv\n\n, the\n\nlearnometer\n\nproject, the \"\n\nbe very afraid\n\n\" film series, etc.).  His presentation lived up to the tags on his website: learning, ingenuity, research, policy, design, technology, and delight.  (I'll blog more about his ideas in a separate posting.)\n\nGlobal issues\n\nare the content.  The appearance of\n\nJean-Francois Rischard\n\n, author of the book\n\nHigh Noon\n\n, at the EARCOS conference was very timely. Consensus on the pressing problem of global warming has coalesced (thanks in part to Al Gore's movie) over the past several months, so it was wonderful to hear from someone who has been thinking seriously about the problem -- and even bigger ones -- for several years.\n\nHis overall message was that we need to come up with a new methodology of global problem-solving because the problems now facing the world must be resolved by countries working together. Like Heppell, Rischard is someone who has been involved in the system he's critiquing, as he used to work for the World Bank and is very knowledgeable about the current international organizations available.  (I'll blog more about his ideas in a separate posting.)\n\nThe popular meme that was killed for me, thanks to these conferences, was\n\nMarc Prensky\n\n's\n\ndigital immigrant/digital native\n\ndivide.  I've been guilty of spreading it myself, but, I'm sorry -- given the rate of change, doesn't the divide continually shift?  Is it meaningful?  Each cohort born will be exposed to some technology at a younger age than those born a few years before.  There was a \"Student Perspectives on IT and Education\" forum at the IBAP conference and the teens who participated (from two different international schools in Singapore) admitted they marvel at how younger kids are utilizing technology at a younger age than they did, e.g., mobile phones.  The term \"digital natives\" did not resonate with them, though they did gripe that many of their teachers were not as digitally fluent as they were.  I much prefer the idea of a digital literacy or fluency continuum, regardless of age.\n\nA focus on an age definition of \"digital natives\" (e.g., born after 1973 or whatever the current year-marker is) also ignores the very real economic digital divide.  To speak sweepingly of a whole digital generation, when many children have yet to touch a digital device, is misleading.\n\nBrain research is strongly linked to this concept of \"digital natives\" and \"digital immigrants\".  I must go back and review the latest reports because almost every speaker (especially that stand-up comic/evangelist preacher\n\nIan Jukes\n\n) made it sound like kids' brains have eternal neuro-plasticity while ours are hopelessly hardwired.   I'm sure I've recently read about the window of neural-plasticity staying open (longer), e.g., that the elderly can even continue to build new neural pathways if they keep mentally fit (the old 'use-it or lost-it' saying).  Anyway, something to look up later.\n\nAs I've mentioned Jukes, I also want to point out something that strikes me as odd about his\n\nblog\n\n.  I've clicked on at least six different postings (see, for example,\n\nVideo Games Focus on Exercising Brain\n\nand\n\nThe Handwriting is on the Wall\n\n) and they appear to be his comments on an article, for which he provides a link at the bottom of the posting.  BUT, when you go to the article, it's word-for-word the same as his posting.  So he seems to be posting whole copies of article texts on his blog with no attribution (neither publication nor author) on the blog itself -- though he does provide a link to the article (which doesn't always work though -- e.g., several link to expired articles (\n\nStudents use IM Lingo in Essays\n\nand\n\nShoes Track Children Using GPS\n\n) and one posting appears to be an image so you can't actually click on the link (\n\n1867 Nanomachine Now Reality\n\n)).  My impression of him was as an energetic re-packager of ideas (I had heard them all before from other sources) and his blog makes it look like he doesn't even do that very well.\n\nWould we really let students copy an article on their blog without indicating that it was NOT their own words in the posting, even if they did provide a link at the end to the real article?  Must review online ethical etiquette sometime...\n\nMore thoughts in separate postings...\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\nEARCOS07\n\n,\n\nIBAP07\n\n,\n\ndigital literacy\n\n,\n\nfuture\n\n,\n\nconferences\n\n,\n\ntechnology",

(see\n\nprevious postin\n\ng)\n\nThe 20 most pressing problems, according to Rischard:\n\nSharing our planet: Issues involving the global commons\n\n1. Global warming\n\n2. Biodiversity and ecosystem losses\n\n3. Fisheries depletion\n\n4. Deforestation\n\n5. Water deficits\n\n6. Maritime safety and pollution\n\nSharing our humanity: Issues requiring a global commitment\n\n7. Massive step-up in the fight against poverty\n\n8.

International labor and migration rules\n\n[both images, above right, taken from www.nais.org]\n\nRischard stresses that these problems require long-term thinking and commitment, something democracies cannot easily deliver (due to electoral pressures). Nation-states, territorial by definition, are also inadequate, given the inherently global nature of the problems. He proposes the establishment of\n\nGlobal Issues Networks\n\n, consisting of experts from various countries appointed by world leaders. These experts will work to extract rough consensus for norms and standards for all countries to adhere to in the interest of the whole world.\n\nRischard said you'd have to tell these experts that they were working for humanity with an eye to each of them winning a Nobel prize for their work. (I love that idea of appealing to their pride!)\n\nThe other thing we'd have to do, he said, is to work towards developing the mindset of global citizenship -- which is where education steps in.\n\nThere are several educational projects, based on Rischard's book and his advocacy, now in place, with more likely.\n\nIn the US, the\n\nNAIS\n\n(National Association of Independent Schools) has a program called\n\nChallenge 20/20\n\n, which pairs schools in the US with a school elsewhere in the world to work on creative global problem solving.\n\nIn Europe there are\n\nGIN (Global Issues Network)\n\ngroups starting up in international schools.  Clayton Lewis, head of the\n\nInternational School of Luxembourg\n\n, has been working with Rischard and a GIN conference is planned for next year.\n\nHere in Asia\n\nWAB (Western Academy of Beijing)\n\nhas a program in place called GIG (Global Issues Group) and they are planning to host a (student?) conference in March 2008.\n\nRischard said he is also meeting with the\n\nIBO\n\nto discuss how his framework could be spread throughout their school network.\n\nIt's all exciting stuff.  Our school already has a well-developed Global Concerns program, but I can see the benefit of becoming part of the Global Issues Network.\n\nTechnorati Tags:\n\nEARCOS07\n\n,\n\nglobal issues\n\n,\n\ninternational schools",

I'm reminded of an article (that I can't provide a link to at the moment) I had to read once about Aborigine children in Australia and how they prefer long periods of observing in the classroom before engaging.  For them public mistakes are worse than delay or inactivity.  Though the teacher might perceive them as dreaming or not on task, they instead act upon a greater requirement to survey what is going on.  Slow but solid absorption.\n\nHowever, the time to start writing is\n\nnow\n\n.  I've signed up to do a workshop at\n\nTeachIT\n\nwith my good friend (and fellow teacher-librarian)\n\nBarb Philip\n\n.  Just a 75 minute workshop -- but for our general international school peers (argh!) here in Singapore on a Saturday in November.\n\nSocial Software -- in school and life\n\nSee how two teacher-librarians have experimented with free (and almost free) internet software to help them collect, organize, and share information online -- and play with these Web 2.0 tools yourself. Guaranteed to get you thinking how you might use them in your classroom as well as for professional networking and personal projects. The sampler will include wikis, social bookmarking, online catalogs, blogs, RSS readers, photo and document sharing, and customized search engines.\n\nIt got a bit truncated in the official line-up, but that was our original description.\n\nIt's a deja-vu experience for me, as that's what I did 18 months ago with\n\nBeth Gourley\n\n.  We signed up to do a workshop for fellow teacher-librarians at\n\nEARCOS\n\n2006.  You never learn anything until you volunteer to present it.  Beth and I threw our combined learning into a wiki, which is still out there --\n\nLibraryTails\n\n-- and surprisingly not that out-of-date.  Barb and I agree we definitely need to pool our content online beforehand.  This workshop will be better than the last one in that it's hands-on.  So we just need a launchpad so people can start playing.  Barb's going to set up a MySpace for us, while I'm going to use this blog to focus on some of our experiences and ideas.\n\nPoem I read recently -- by Eve Merriam:\n\nA Lazy Thought\n\nThere go the grown ups\n\nTo the office,\n\nTo the store.\n\nSubway rush,\n\nTraffic crush;\n\nHurry, scurry,\n\nWorry, flurry.\n\nNo wonder\n\nGrown ups\n\nDon't grow up\n\nAny more.\n\nIt takes a lot\n\nOf slow\n\nTo grow.",

      "content": "Two major problems with the Internet are:\n\ntoo much information\n\ntoo many tools to choose from\n\nGiven that, it's best to think of an information problem as an excuse to play around with social software.\n\nThe problem Barb and I face -- with this workshop -- is how to organize the information we want to share with people while minimizing the \"presentation\" talking and maximizing the \"hands-on\" aspect.\n\nFor now, I'm going to blog about the kinds of problems social software has solved for me -- and we'll wait to figure out the best kind of online launch pad for the workshop.\n\nPROBLEM:\n\nHow to get\n\nphotographs\n\nonline -- to share with others or simply to store for personal projects?\n\nSOLUTION:\n\nUse an online photo sharing site, like\n\nFlickr\n\n(see\n\nHow to Select a Photo Sharing Site for Newbies\n\n).  Flickr has a tour available on its home page, which is one place to start.\n\nAnother way is to just start searching for photos on Flickr, e.g.,\n\nphotos tagged \"Singapore\"\n\nor\n\nphotos including the word \"Hmong\"\n\n.\n\nFlickr also allows you to put photos in Sets and then to put Sets into Collections.  For instance, I have a Collection called\n\nUWCSEA Primary Library\n\n, which contains 8 sets, e.g.,\n\nWriters' Camp 2007: Telunas Beach\n\nand\n\n07-08 UWCSEA Primary Library Displays\n\n.  It's my way of recording what I do in the library. I have another collection called\n\nOther School Libraries\n\nwhere I keep sets of photos of libraries taken on professional peer visits.\n\nNB: I can control who can see any photo by specifying its privacy level -- public, friend, or family.\n\nBy becoming \"friends\" with people and adding them to your Contact list, then you can automatically see when they upload new photos.   For instance, Barb just became a grandmother and when I login to Flickr, I can see\n\nthe latest photos she's uploaded of the baby\n\n-- because she's one of my Contacts.\n\nThere are also Groups you can join.  I'm thinking of joining the\n\n365 Library Days Project\n\n-- where you are supposed to take one photo a day of your library for a year and post them on Flickr.  Search for groups that interest you.   Take a look at\n\nall these Singapore groups on Flickr\n\n.\n\nHow could Flickr be used in the classroom?  Read about\n\nPhoto Sharing in Education\n\nin the\n\nTeaching Hacks Wiki\n\n(which has enough material there to keep you occupied for another Saturday or two).\n\nPeople are doing\n\nall kinds of fun stuff with Flickr\n\n.  I like this \"\n\nSpell with Flickr\n\n\" application -- which takes text as input and gives you back photos that spell out the text, e.g.,:",

      "content": "Seen\n\na list of all the Google products\n\nlately?  It's impressive.  (Check out\n\nthe [French] map of these products\n\nand how they relate to one another, though -- mind -- it's as enormous as Google's influence....  I prefer\n\nthe more impressionistic (and English) map of Googleland\n\n....)\n\nMaybe Google is taking over the world, but I'm still a happy user.\n\nMy favorite tools are\n\nGmail\n\n,\n\nGoogle Reader\n\n,\n\niGoogle\n\n, and\n\nGoogle Notebook\n\n.\n\nI love\n\nGmail\n\nwith its ability to tag e-mails with multiple labels -- effectively allowing them to \"live\" in multiple folders -- makes managing the inbox so easy.  (I don't know if any of you subscribe to multiple listservs -- but Gmail makes it easy to set up filters and automatically tag/label posts as they come in -- have a read here about\n\nhow I manage my listserv traffic using a second Gmail account\n\n, if you're interested...)\n\nEven if you don't use Gmail, you can still get a Google account and access their other products.\n\nGoogleReader\n\nis hard to show off -- as you would have to be logged into my Google account to see my (170+) feeds and my pile of reading.  But they now allow you to identify items for sharing.  This is the public webpage of\n\nmy GoogleReader shared items\n\n.  They also allow you to post clips of your most recent shared items on your blog (so you should see them on the upper left of my blog page).\n\niGoogle\n\nis Google's home page option for you.  Again, you can't see mine unless you log in as me.  But I can tell you it's got feeds from my various social software tools -- my LibraryThing catalog, my del.icio.us account, my GoogleDocs, my Gmail, my GoogleReader, etc., plus a \"to-do\" list that I maintain.\n\nGoogleNotebook\n\nallows me to make notes and mark websites for later reading/action.  I can share these notebooks, e.g., Barb and I shared one in planning for this workshop.  While we have read/write privileges, GoogleNotebook also has an option to make a notebook public -- so you can see what we have in our notebook called\n\nSocial Software Workshop\n\n.\n\nWill Richardson over on\n\nWeblogg-ed\n\nrecently asked the blogosphere:\n\nWhat’s Your Process?\n\nSeriously. I want to know. What do you do when you read a couple of sentences in a post or article that really resonate? How do you capture and organize those snippets? What tools do you use? How often do you recall those sentences, access them? How do you search for them? Is your process working?\n\nLots of people answered him -- and I couldn't resist adding\n\nmy two cents\n\n:\n\nLike so many others posting here, I’m a huge fan of Google Notebook, available wherever there’s internet access, from any machine. Definitely download the Firefox extension, so with one right-click, you can pop in a snippet and a link.\n\nWhen I go through my Google Reader inbox, I make entries in my various Google Notebooks of things I want to follow up on or want to make notes on (though, yes, I also use del.icio.us to log websites, as well as diigo).\n\nI maintain a number of notebooks and it’s easy to move notes from one to the other. For example, one is for “Books of interest” — definitely useful before heading to the library or bookstore. Another notebook holds my “Notes on books read”. Yet another is “Articles to think about”.\n\nAs a teacher-librarian, I work with a variety of classes on different units of inquiry — and I create a new Google notebook for each one. It lets me build up ideas, links, etc. to sort through later.\n\nIn a couple of weeks a friend and I are doing a short workshop on Social Software for fellow teachers and we’re using a “shared” Google notebook to log and comment on sites, ideas, quotes, etc.\n\nMy “General” notebook is useful for logging things like airplane ticket reservations (so I don’t have to wait for the confirmation e-mail to arrive in my in-box — I just clip the relevant information and feel safe to leave the ticketing webpage).\n\nI use iGoogle as my personal homepage so my Google notebooks are readily available (along with my Gmail, my Google Reader, etc.) Yes, I’m a Google fan…\n\nGoogleDocs\n\nis another way to collect and share information.  You can upload text documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoint presentations -- and invite other people to become collaborators.  Barb and I also use it frequently to give each other access to documents -- rather than attaching Word documents to e-mails.\n\nNov. 19:\n\nJust discovered that those clever folks at\n\nThe Common Craft Show\n\nhave produced one of their super-simple explanatory videos for GoogleDocs:\n\nGoogleDocs in Plain English\n\nThe folks at Google are constantly coming up with new ideas (during that 20% of their free-thinking time).\n\nGoogle Custom Search Engines\n\n(though note, they're not the only ones out there) are a powerful tool, especially for teachers/librarians who want to enforce some quality control on students' searching. You get to specify exactly which sites and/or pages will be searched. I've already created several for my primary school students, e.g.,\n\nMs. Day's General Search Engine for Kids\n\nand an\n\nAztec Search Engine\n\n.  Both only search sites that I am confident have information at the level of primary school students.\n\nAnother more recent addition to the field is\n\nDeliGoo\n\n, a\n\ndel.icio.us\n\nsearch engine. It's a Firefox extension that allows you to search just the websites tagged in a del.icio.us account, e.g.,",

      "title": "What is \"Social Graph-Based Search\"? -- and will it overtake Google?",
      "content": "Robert Scoble,\n\na well-known Internet guru, makes some strong arguments that Google is going to be left behind in terms of search (over the next few years) because its core strength is about search engine optimization techniques (i.e., how people can tweak their webpage to come out higher in the rankings because of knowing how the search algorithm works).\n\nInstead Scoble believes social graph-based searching -- or tapping into people-based networks for information -- will reign supreme in the search world, and he discusses three in particular:\n\nMahalo\n\n,\n\nFacebook\n\n, and\n\nTechMeme\n\n.\n\nWatch these three video tutorials of Robert Scoble talking about \"Social Graph-Based Search\":\n\nPart I\n\nPart II\n\nPart III\n\nHe talks about a fabric of trust -- makes me think of librarians as a reliable fabric in society, providing trusted information ....\n\nScoble asks, what if everyone has their own Mahalo?  Our own network of  \"people-based systems\"....\n\nYou'll probably have heard of\n\nFacebook\n\n(if not, see\n\nits Wikipedia entry\n\n-- and consider the fact that it has almost 50 million active users and Microsoft just paid $240m for a 1.6% stake in the company).\n\nTechMeme\n\nis more for technology addicts, while\n\nMahalo\n\n, subtitled \"Human-Powered Search\",  is designed for the general public.\n\nI think Mahalo has a lot of potential.  Their \"guides\" (as they call the people who put their pages together) are basically creating what librarians call \"pathfinders\" -- a summary of the best links on a particular topic.  See, for example,\n\nMahalo's School Subjects\n\nlist.  Students should find some of those pages quite useful, e.g., the page on\n\nHamlet\n\nhas everything you might need.... same goes for the page on\n\nIan McEwa\n\nn.....  I know the book club I belong to would find the\n\nthe Authors and Writers pages\n\nuseful...\n\nMahalo also has some good intro \"how-to\" pages on technology, e.g.,\n\nHow to Use del.icio.us Like a Pro\n\nHow to Choose a Photo Sharing Site for Newbies\n\nHow to Use Flickr Like a Pro\n\nI read\n\na recent article/interview with Jason Calacanis\n\n, the founder of Mahalo.\n\nHis plan was devilishly clever: He would create a human-powered search engine that builds out prefab responses to the most popular search terms. He would shoot for the top 30%, or about 15,000 terms, to effectively skim the cream from the entire search business. Mahalo would deliver results for searches like \"Paris Hilton,\" \"iPod,\" and \"Bill Gates,\" but not for your local high-school football team or childhood sweetheart. And because those results would be prepared by humans, sifted and sorted and condensed for maximum relevance, users would no longer be faced with 10 million hits, as they are with Google, but with a few dozen. Mahalo would be a search engine for people who don't like to search.\n\nEvidently Mahalo has about 60 employees so far.\n\nMost of Calacanis's employees are young out-of-work novelists, screenwriters, musicians, artists, and actors--info addicts happy to earn $35,000 a year plus health benefits by searching the Web rather than shelving books at Barnes & Noble or slinging chai lattes at Starbucks. Calacanis has promised them 15% of the company when and if it goes public, with the investors getting a third and Calacanis keeping the rest.\n\n(Why doesn't he try to hire librarians, who are trained in searching and evaluating information??)\n\nAnyway, if you like Mahalo, you might also look at\n\nSquidoo\n\n-- which is openly social (like Wikipedia, meaning anyone can create pages).  Here's how they describe themselves:\n\nSquidoo\n\nis a website hosting hundreds of thousands of lenses. Each lens is one person's look at something online. Your take on football or business or the best thai food in town.   Lenses are\n\nfree\n\n.",

Though on the\n\nThe Southport School library webpage\n\nher job title is listed as Senior Librarian, she says she was hired ten years ago as Director of Information Services.  Instead, Director of Literacy might be appropriate.\n\nHer talk was titled:\n\nMaintaining Momentum: Keeping boys reading in the middle school years\n\n, and she gave us an overview of her philosophy and practices behind the creation of an active reading community in a day/boarding boys' school with an enrolment of approximately 1400 preschool to year 12.\n\nShe swears by\n\nStephen Krashen\n\n's\n\nThe Power of Reading\n\n,\n\nAidan Chambers\n\n's\n\nThe Reading Environment\n\n,\n\nYoung Australians Reading\n\n, and\n\nKnowing Readers\n\nby Susan LaMarca and Pam MacIntyre.\n\nThe key is getting the whole community involved\n\n-- a giant partnership -- which means not just the library and the English department, but all staff (even the cleaners) and the parents.   The goal is an environment which legitimizes wide and comprehensive reading.\n\nSome elements of her successful program:\n\n* All students keep\n\nReading Records\n\n-- lists of the books they've read in and out of school -- that follow them throughout their time at the school (so any teacher can see any student's reading history);\n\n*\n\nBook reports are 40-second oral events\n\n, done at the end of term -- no long boring writing about what you've read;\n\n*\n\nBook chat time\n\n-- lots of it -- in classrooms, in the library, in the hallways;\n\n*\n\nAuthor visits\n\n-- as many as possible;\n\n*\n\nRegular silent reading\n\ntimes throughout the school, e.g., every English class starts with 10 minutes of silent reading, and Grades 8-10 English classes come to the library every fortnight for a session of book talk and reading;\n\n*\n\nMonthly book club\n\n(and newsletter), where students get the pick of new library books to read and review;  she also takes club members out to literary festivals and any events related to books;\n\n* Ongoing\n\ncollection of data\n\n-- such as surveys to find out what the kids are reading and how they think reading helps them; this data is shared with teachers, admin, and parents;\n\n* Tons of\n\nbook displays\n\n, e.g., the first display of the year is of books which the students voted  as their favorites the year before;\n\n*\n\n7-week parent program\n\nat the beginning of each year -- in which she teaches parents the same information literacy skills the kids learn;\n\n*\n\nBig book collection\n\n, catering for all reading levels and a wide variety of interests;  she said she buys for everyone (including parents); I like her attitude that she's about choice, not censorship -- she says it's not her job to censor what a child reads -- parents can do that by submitting a form;\n\n* Supporting\n\nteachers as readers\n\nand getting them to advertise their reading to students, e.g., before every holiday break, she takes a stack of books into the staff room and passes them out, and teachers in all subject areas are encouraged to produce bookmarks of their recent reads and have them available in their classrooms for students to take;\n\n*\n\nReader's Cup\n\n(an annual competition in Australia) -- she always get a team to enter;\n\n*\n\nWriting competitions\n\n-- she encourages students to enter any online writing competition and says some students have won money from them.\n\nThree websites she recommends:\n\nThe Children's Book Council of Australia\n\nInside a Dog\n\n-- a website dedicated to books for young adults\n\nThe Source\n\n-- a (subscription) database of children's literature, especially Australian, and connected to the children's literature journal,\n\nMagpies\n\nGiven my current situation, I was particularly pleased to hear her say, of course, she lets parents borrow.  And her response to my query about borrowing limits was, unlimited!  (She did admit there are borrowing limits printed in some library policy document, but they are not enforced.)  Letters about overdue books are sent to parents after two months and any financial reckoning about lost books is only done at the end of term.  So reasonable...\n\nI also noted her comment that circular tables in the library encourage social booktalking.  Made me decide I must get to IKEA to replace a few of my dreary institutional rectangles with round colorful ones.",

The power of the social comes from seeing how others make use of tools.  So we're hoping\n\nour chart\n\nwill get filled in with examples from our participants.\n\nWhat is the best way to share information?\n\nSHARING LISTS OF BOOKS: Example 1:\n\nPYP Resources\n\nPYP teacher-librarians are always being asked to provide a book that exemplifies the\n\nIB Learner Profile\n\n.  And paper lists of relevant books are always being passed around.  My solution to this was\n\nLibraryThing\n\n, an online cataloguing program.\n\nMy catalog --\n\nUWC_PYP\n\n(see\n\ndescription\n\n)\n\nstarted out as a means of consolidating lists of books that relate to\n\nthe IB Learner Profile\n\n(examples of how we can be\n\nInquirers\n\n,\n\nThinkers\n\n,\n\nCommunicators\n\n,\n\nRisk-takers\n\n,\n\nKnowledgeable\n\n,\n\nPrincipled\n\n,\n\nCaring\n\n,\n\nOpen-minded\n\n,\n\nBalanced\n\n, and\n\nReflective\n\n), however, it's now all-purpose.\n\nFor example, my children's literature discussion group recently focused on books featuring contemporary cultures.  So I took the various recommendations and information collected them under the tag \"contemporary cultures\" in my UWC_PYP catalog.  Voila! --\n\nan instant \"contemporary cultures\" reading list\n\n.\n\nAs the school librarian, I also have been frustrated with finding out (and keeping track) of the sets of novels available (but not easily accessible) in all the grade levels' reading cupboards.  I run an after-school book club so always need new sets of novels.  Once I got the teachers to give me their paper lists, I quickly entered them in a LibraryThing catalog:\n\nUWC_novelsets\n\n.\n\nNote how the tags\n\ntell me where the books are and how many are available (where '?' indicates I'm still not sure!).",

(Thanks to Susan Sedro for\n\npointing the link out on her blog\n\n,\n\nAdventures in Educational Blogging\n\n...)\n\nHe's a huge presence on the literacy scene -- especially in Australia.  See, for example, this\n\nlist of literacy links, including Allan Luke's Four Resources model\n\n, gathered by Rosemary Horton at the P.L. Duffy Resource Centre at Trinity College (Western Australia).\n\nI'm also a fan of various colleagues of his over the years (all connected with Australia or Canada):\n\nColin Lankshear / Michele Knobel (see their blog,\n\nEveryday Literacies\n\n, as well as their book\n\nNew Literacies: everyday practices and classroom learning\n\n)\n\nCushla Kapitzke\n\n(at Queensland University of Technology, Australia)\n\nKieran Egan\n\n(at Simon Fraser University, Canada)\n\nIt's interesting that Allan Luke has connections to Singapore as well.  He worked here for a few years (some time ago) and is the Foundation Dean, Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice, National          Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\n\nIn the webcast, Allan Luke mentions\n\nVivian Vasquez\n\n-- a name I hadn't come across before in the field of critical literacy.

      "content": "Another video that spiraled round the web (and got so much media attention that the guy has been offered a book contract - to write in these last months before he dies of cancer)  is\n\nProf. Randy Pausch's Last Lecture: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams\n\n, given at Carnegie Mellon back in September.  Well worth it.   (The\n\nWikipedia page on Randy\n\nhas links to everything -- e.g., listen/read his lecture on Time Management -- sure to make you feel like a sluggard...)\n\nRandy reminds us what the brick walls of life\n\nare there for.\n\nThe brick walls are not there to keep us out.  The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.  Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough.  They're there to stop\n\nother\n\npeople.\n\nOn the last day of school I hit a brick wall of sorts -- and what do librarians do when they're feeling low?  They go to a library.  Nothing like a new book, a new outlook, to perk you up.  There I picked up two books, in that serendipitous way, which were particularly apt.\n\nOne was\n\nThe Dip: a little book that teaches you when to quit (and when to stick)\n\n(2007) by\n\nSeth Godin\n\n, marketing guru, author and\n\nblogger\n\n(see/hear also his recent\n\nTED talk\n\n).\n\nGodin goes on about why it's best to be number one in whatever niche you find yourself, in this world of a million micromarkets -- to focus on the \"short head\" rather than the \"long tail\".  That's it's not good enough any more to be well rounded -- you need to persevere and get beyond the Dip, the slump between starting and mastery, between \"the artificial screens set up to keep people like you out\" [Randy's brick wall] -- because the Dip creates scarcity which creates value.  Beat Mediocrity! is his mantra.\n\nThe other book --\n\nAvoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science\n\n(2007) -- by\n\nJames Watson\n\n, of DNA \"double helix\" fame -- also talks, in the context of academic politics, about the need to be the best.  He laments how for years Harvard, where he was teaching, refused to hire other biologists working at the cutting edge, leaving rival institutions like MIT to scoop up the best geneticists.  The reason?  Harvard was complacent about already being the best.  \"Academic institutions do not easily change themselves\" is one (not very surprising) lesson he shares.\n\nBack to my world now.... How can we claim to be offering a world-class education if we don't have world-class libraries and information literacy programs?  They think our test results are doing just fine, that such things are luxuries.  As if results are the only yardstick...\n\nOur stats certainly don't measure up to a top school -- judging by the recently published\n\nSchool Libraries Count! A National Survey of School Library Media Programs 2007\n\n(American Library Association), e.g., in terms of number of qualified teacher-librarians per student, size of the collection per student, spending per student, etc.  (The Australian school/library associations are\n\nin the process of doing their own survey\n\n-- and I look forward to seeing their numbers.)\n\nBut, then, I must remember \"culture codes\" (again, see\n\nThe Culture Code\n\n(2006)  by\n\nClotaire Rapaille\n\n) come into play.  What is the code for \"school library\" in different cultures? and how does that affect the position of libraries in international schools?\n\nWe are a British heritage school and the UK simply does not have a strong tradition of school librarianship.   According to\n\na CILIP survey\n\n, less than 30% of secondary schools in England are run by qualified librarians, either full or part-time.  How many of those qualified librarians are also qualified teachers isn't mentioned (very few, I suspect) -- as school librarians are not expected to be teachers in the UK -- unlike in the US, Australia, NZ, and Canada.\n\nSo there is only a limited code for \"school librarian\" in the UK and no cultural code for \"teacher-librarian\" (or \"school library media specialist\", as they're called in the US).  It reminds me of\n\nClotaire Rapaille's story\n\nof how Nestle came to him for advice when they were having trouble selling instant coffee in Japan -- and he told them there was no cultural code for coffee there, then recommended they establish one by marketing coffee-flavored desserts to children and wait for the kids to grow up.\n\nI need to find a way for my administrators to experience the value added by a secondary school teacher-librarian and a dynamic secondary school library program... to establish a code...",

Her illustration of a culture driven by stuff allows her to isolate the moment in history where she says the trend of consumption mania began. The “Story of Stuff” examines how economic policies of the post-World War II era ushered in notions of consumerism — and how those notions are still driving much of the U.S. and global economies today.\n\n-- taken from the\n\npress release\n\nYes, it's political -- and very American, e.g., in its definition (and images)  of government, but the message is still worth spreading.  Especially as we approach the great consumer holiday of Christmas.\n\nWhen Annie Leonard laments American culture as one that glorifies shopping and accepts planned obsolescence, I couldn't help but think of how it echoes some of the American \"codes\" described by\n\nClotaire Rapaille\n\nin his book\n\nThe Culture Code\n\n(2006):\n\nAmerican code for shopping = RECONNECTING WITH LIFE (going out to play)\n\nAmerican code for quality = IT WORKS (service is more important to Americans than great quality -- because \"it works\")\n\nAmerican code for perfection = DEATH",

Her delivery is dramatic, poetic, and funny. (I've already suggested her as a speaker for\n\na TED conference\n\n.)\n\nHer emphasis on the importance of the face-to-face interaction between teachers and students reminds me of one of my favorite poems --\n\n\"Did I Miss Anything\" by Tom Wayland\n\n-- subtitled, \"Question frequently asked by students after missing a class\".\n\nEdson\n\nspoke at Commencement Day at\n\nSmith College\n\nthis past May -- her alma mater, and mine, which is how I came across her speech -- in one of those usually boring email bulletins.

Edson claims she wrote her Smith college application essay on the theme, via Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Montaigne.  I've always preferred Cavafy's expression of it in the poem \"\n\nIthaka\n\n\".\n\nEdson is passionate about her job\n\nas a kindergarten teacher and considers giving children the power to read as the best way she can change the world.\n\n\"Reading and writing is power--the thing that gives you the most power in your whole life. I like being part of students acquiring that power. I like handing that power over.\"",

Others, from our old campus, did get to go, e.g., Ben Morgan gave a workshop on\n\nCreating a 21st Century Learning Environment in Your School: From Strategic Vision to Reality\n\n(his slide presentation and handouts are available for download from that link page).  As IT director, his take is the big picture and I appreciate we've come a long way, however, I still chafe at StudyWiz and its inability to let people roam around and see what other teachers are doing.  It's structure is basically silos, or, what happens in your classroom stays in your classroom.  It may suit secondary, but not primary.  Though we at the East Campus are trying to find ways to be as open as possible, using the StudyWiz junior interface.\n\nRoaming around the Learning 2.0 conference ning,  \"21st Century\" jumps out as a major buzzword.

He asks, how do we move students from being knowledgeable to being knowledge-able?\n\nWesch uses\n\nNetvibes\n\nto provide a platform for student participation:\n\nMediated Cultures: Digital Ethnography at Kansas State University\n\nOn a much smaller scale, for much younger students, Keri-Lee and I are playing around with\n\nPageflakes\n\nto create\n\na portal for our primary school students\n\n.

When she later goes back to re-read that first novel, she finds it quite easy and interesting.\n\nAnd it occurred to her (as next day she wrote down) that reading was, among other things, a muscle and one that she had seemingly developed.\n\nThis is the point of my favorite non-fiction literacy book of 2008.\n\nProust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain\n\nrepresents a snapshot — to be precise, three snapshots — of what we now know about the origins of reading (how the human brain learned how to read); the development of reading (from infancy's influence, to expert reading adults); the gifts and the challenges of reading failure in dyslexia (what happens when the brain can't read).

It's a hot topic.\n\nIn July 2008 the New York Times published the first in a series of articles looking at\n\nhow the Internet and other technological and social forces are changing the way people read.

      "content": "A question every school librarian must face is,\n\nto cover? or not to cover?\n\nIn plastic.\n\nFor our new library, I choose to buy hardcovers whenever possible -- only adding a plastic layer to books with dust jackets where the jacket alone carries a front cover image (i.e., when the hardcover itself is plain).   Any paperbacks I buy are being left as is.  No sticky-back plastic -- of any kind.\n\nIt's a decision of cost -- of the plastic, of the labor spent attaching the plastic, and to the environment which must live with the plastic for its lifetime.\n\nA similar question every school/teacher must face is,\n\nto laminate? or not to laminate?\n\nMy friend Pam Duncan, a head librarian in control of the school's laminating machine, has single-handedly managed to significantly reduce her school's plastic footprint by insisting staff justify each and every act of lamination to her personally.\n\n-- Poster by\n\nJohn Blyberg\n\n(CC-Attribution); hat-tip\n\nMichael Stephens\n\nand then\n\nLibraryThing\n\n;\n\nFYI: created using\n\nDespair, Inc\n\n.'s\n\nParody Motivator Generator\n\nDoes plastic convey authority? And does it allow users to abdicate personal responsibility?  As\n\nTim from LibraryThing comments\n\n(on the above poster):\n\nI've wondered if lamination and similar protective techniques in libraries don't encourage the very disaster they anticipate—\"Oh, the book has a plastic cover on it? I guess that means its okay if I read it while eating a meatball sub!\"\n\nI know I'm doing lots of talking with students about their responsibility to respect books, given that we're not exerting any extra effort to give books extra protection. (\n\nResponsibility\n\nand\n\nRespect\n\nare two key terms in the\n\nPYP\n\n.)\n\nOn the other hand, books may rapidly become completely recyclable so when that meatball sub falls onto it, you just pop it in the back of the \"recycler/fabricator\" that we'll have in our homes -- and produce a new copy (or print out a different book).\n\nWitness\n\nthe all-plastic, waterproof, completely recyclable book\n\n,\n\nCradle to Cradle: Remaking How We Make Things\n\n, a manifesto calling for ecologically intelligent design.\n\nTo eliminate the concept of waste means to design things -- products, packaging, and systems -- from the very beginning on the understanding that waste does not exist.\n\n(p. 104, Cradle to Cradle)\n\nIntentionally recyclable physical books aren't that prevalent yet, though we do have the ability to print and bind paperback books from scratch in minutes, via machines like\n\nthe EBM (Espresso Book Machine)\n\n-- at a cost of a US$0.01 per page.\n\nWatch these two short videos and think how far we have come:\n\n1947 video \"Making Books\" produced by Encyclopedia Britannica Films\n\nin collaboration with the Library of Congress -- a classic black and white informational video showing how books used to be produced -- from the author's manuscript to typesetting to lines to composed pages to copper plates, printing, binding, covering, etc.\n\n(Thanks to the graphic artist student\n\nGolden Krishna\n\nfor discovering this precious piece of history -- and my apologies that I can't trace now who led me to his website...)\n\nThe Espresso Book Machine\n\n-- in action!\n\nWhich brings me to Brewster Kahle, the inventor, philanthropist and digital librarian, who is trying to bring everything ever published to anyone who wants it -- universal access to all knowledge.   He's working to digitize all the texts of the world and, because he still likes the old-fashioned technology of \"the book\", he's experimenting with machines like the Espresso Book Machine in places like rural Uganda -- to bring books to people who need/want them.  Listen to him talk about his various projects at TED in December 2007.\n\nYou can't talk about digitizing all the books in the world without mentioning the latest e-book readers, like the\n\nKindle\n\n(thanks to\n\nJohn Blyberg\n\nfor another photo). Kahle and others tout\n\nthe $100 laptop\n\nas a\n\ngreat device for reading e-books\n\n.  Watch\n\nRobin Ashford\n\ndemonstrate it on YouTube\n\nbelow.

      "title": "Common Genius and Creativity",
      "content": "I've been reading and digesting several thinkers/texts/thoughts on creativity -- and the genius of the cultural commons.\n\n(Image credit:\n\nlightbulbs by andydoro\n\n)\n\nThe individual genius is definitely a discredited idea these days.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell addresses this issue in his May 2008 article,\n\n\"In the Air: who says big ideas are rare?\"\n\n-- where he uses the example of\n\nNathan Myhrvold\n\nand his attempt to create a group capable of generating insights that might lead to scientific inventions and innovation.  Gladwell asserts that \"the genius is not a unique source of insight; he is merely an efficient source of insight.\"\n\nGladwell's latest book,\n\n\"Outliers: the story of success\"\n\n, similarly argues that those people who achieve extreme success owe a great deal to the fortuitous ecology of their lives.  \"They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy.\" And the success of late bloomers, like Cezanne, is highly contingent on the efforts of others surrounding and supporting them (he says in a New Yorker article on October 20, 2008,\n\n\"Late Bloomers: why do we equate genius with precocity?\"\n\n).\n\n\"For Innovators, There is Brainpower in Numbers\"\n\nran a recent article in the New York Times, affirming that \"truly productive invention requires the meeting of minds from myriad perspectives, even if the innovators themselves don't always realize it.\"  The article interestingly argues that brainstorming (or \"idea showers\" as some teachers I know prefer to call it -- eliminating that negative imagery), introduced in 1948, has been proved to be less effective than generally believed.  Evidently, \"individuals working alone generate more ideas than groups acting in concert\".  Instead, \"systematic inventive thinking\" is better, where successful products are analyzed into separate components and considered for alternative uses.  \"The best innovations occur when you have networks of people with diverse backgrounds gathering around a problem.\"\n\nClay Shirky\n\n, professor of new media at New York University and author of\n\n\"Here Comes Everybody: the power of organizing without organizations\"\n\n, argues the same thing, especially in regards to the internet and Web n.0.  (See\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n\nfor videos of him presenting the ideas of the book.) He refers to the two kinds of social capital --\n\nbonding capital\n\n, best envisaged as the number of people willing to lend you a large sum of money without asking when you'll be paying it back, and\n\nbridging capital\n\n, the number of people to whom you would lend small amounts of money without much fuss.  (In other words, bonding capital is more exclusive, bridging capital is more inclusive.)\n\nShirky asserts it's not how many people you know, it's how many different kinds of people -- that most good ideas come from people who are bridging \"structural holes\" in an institution -- because too much bonding capital in a group results in an echo-chamber of ideas.  This is not creativity born of deep intellectual ability -- it's creativity as an import-export business.\n\nAside re school librarians:  we are particularly well-suited to bring bridging capital (read: new ideas) to planning meetings, interacting as we do with all grade levels.\n\nGladwell, in an interview, also credits his own writing success with the breadth and diversity of his friendship base, when asked where he gets his ideas:\n\nPeople tell me things. I have learned, I suppose, how to position myself to have access to serendipitous moments. I fill my life with people from diverse backgrounds. I have friends in academia, in business, in technology. Once you understand the importance of those contacts you can take steps to increase the likelihood of having them pay off. I never come up with things entirely by myself. It's always in combination with somebody. I exploit the entire resources of my friends very efficiently.\n\nCharles Leadbeater\n\n, a UK consultant on innovation and creativity, came out with a book similar to Shirky's at roughly the same time --\n\nWe-Think: mass innovation, not mass production\n\n.  Videos of him speaking about the book can be found\n\nhere\n\n-- and there is a 3-minute animated illustration of the book on his\n\nhomepage\n\n.  (I must admit, I like his plain confession,\n\nThis is Not a Blog\n\n.)\n\nLeadbeater brings up\n\nLewis Hyde\n\n, poet, essayist, and author of\n\n\"The Gift\"\n\n, a book (first published in 1983) dedicated to exploring the gift economy, especially with regard to the arts, though also including the internet -- and the power of sharing and becoming aware of the gifts cycling throughout society.  Hyde was recently the focus of a New York Times Magazine article --\n\n\"What is Art For?\"\n\n-- in which he distinguishes his take on the artistic commons as more academic, abstract, and aesthetically nuanced compared with that of\n\nLawrence Lessig\n\n, founder and guru of the (more legalistic)\n\nCreative Commons\n\nmovement.  (See Lessig's brilliant TED talk on\n\nHow Creativity is being Strangled by the Law\n\n.)\n\nHyde's book explores the concept of the gift economy (contrasted to the market/commodity economy), roaming through anthropology, mythology, and poetry (Walt Whitman and Ezra Pound, in particular) -- and likens it to our current understanding of ecology -- that every gift calls for a return gift in a large self-regulating earth system.  He notes the traditional types of gifts -- separation gifts, threshold gifts or gifts of passage (birthdays, graduation, marriage, newcomers),  and incorporation gifts (goodbye presents meant to give a piece of yourself to someone going away).  Transformative gifts are less concrete, but no less important, and cover the situation of a young artist awakened to their life's labor by another's artistic gift to the world, with the paradox of the gift exchange -- that when a gift is used, it is not used up -- and how the only gratitude required is the act of passing the gift along.  (I could go on and on -- read the book -- it's available from the\n\nNational Library\n\nfor those of you in Singapore.)\n\nSpeaking of gifts -- look at this mindmap someone (\n\nAustin Kleon\n\n) has put up on Flickr re Hyde's book:\n\nIt is obvious how this all relates to Web n.0.  Here, for example, is a snippet about sharing from\n\na blog posting\n\nby\n\nMark Pesce\n\n, an Australian future-oriented consultant:\n\nThe center of this argument is simple, though subtle: the more something is shared, the more valuable it becomes. You extend your brand with every resource you share. You extend the knowledge of your institution throughout the Internet. Whatever you have – if it’s good enough – will bring people to your front door, first virtually, then physically.\n\nSpeaking of giving things away,\n\nSeth Godin\n\n, major marketing guru, is giving away his most recent book, \"Tribes\" --\n\nas an audio book\n\n.  (I listened to it while doing housework one Sunday -- a perfect way to enhance menial tasks.)\n\nHis little book is about leaders -- and how tribes (the small units we're going to find ourselves belonging to) need them -- for the 7 C's:  challenge, creating a culture, curiosity, communication, charisma, connection, and commitment.   He defines leadership as the art of giving people a platform for spreading ideas that work.  That leaders give people stories they can tell about themselves -- and that you can't lead without imagination (read: creativity).\n\nInteresting aside:  there's\n\na new social anthropology book out by Daniel Miller\n\nwhich argues that in London now every household is, in effect, a tribe.\n\nAnother free download (pass that gift on) to note:\n\nLittle Brother -- a popular young adult novel\n\nby\n\nCory Doctorow\n\nof\n\nBoing Boing\n\nfame.  Re the creativity of young people in evading Big Brother's attempt to control them and the internet.\n\nBack to creativity:  I must, of course, mention a few other TED talks on the subject:  Sir Ken Robinson -- if people know any TED talk, it's usually this one:\n\nDo Schools Kill Creativity?\n\nSee also\n\nAmy Tan\n\n-- and\n\nTim Brown\n\n.\n\nI'm going to end with\n\nAlison Gopnik\n\n, psychology/philosophy professor and child development expert and her musings on why fiction is so attractive to children (oops, humans) in the 2006\n\nEdge\n\n\"World Question Center\".\n\nThe greatest success of cognitive science has been our account of the visual system. There's a world out there sending information to our eyes, and our brains are beautifully designed to recover the nature of that world from that information. I've always thought that science, and children's learning, worked the same way. Fundamental capacities for causal inference and learning let scientists, and children, get an accurate picture of the world around them - a theory. Cognition was the way we got the world into our minds.\n\nBut fiction doesn't fit that picture - its easy to see why we want the truth but why do we work so hard telling lies? I thought that kids' pretend play, and grown-up fiction, must be a sort of spandrel, a side-effect of some other more functional ability....\n\nSo the anomaly of pretend play has been bugging me all this time. But finally, trying to figure it out has made me change my mind about the very nature of cognition itself.\n\nI still think that we're designed to find out about the world, but that's not our most important gift.\n\nFor human beings the really important evolutionary advantage is our ability to create new worlds....\n\nIn fact, I think now that the two abilities - finding the truth about the world and creating new worlds-are two sides of the same coins. Theories, in science or childhood, don't just tell us what's true - they tell us what's possible, and they tell us how to get to those possibilities from where we are now.\n\nWhen children learn and when they pretend they use their knowledge of the world to create new possibilities. So do we whether we are doing science or writing novels. I don't think anymore that Science and Fiction are just both Good Things that complement each other. I think they are, quite literally, the same thing.",

      "content": "Just found some notes on an essay of\n\nLewis Hyde\n\n-- \"Two Accidents: Reflection on Chance and Creativity\" (1998).\n\n\"The agile mind is pleased to find what it was not looking for.\"\n\n\"Wandering is the trick, and giving up on 'loss' or 'gain', and then agility of mind.\"\n\nDumb luck = luck of chance\n\nSmart luck = craft added to accident, i.e, \"a kind of responsive intelligence invoked by whatever happens\"\n\nLouis Pasteur quote: \"chance favors the prepared mind\", i.e., a mind prepared for what it isn't prepared for...\n\nChogyam Trungpa quote:  \"magic is the total appreciation of chance\"\n\ncreation (absolute newness) vs. revelation (accident as a tool of revelation)\n\nAbsolute newness = \"in a civilization as complex and shifting as ours has become, a readiness to let the mind change as contingency demands may be one prerequisite of a happy life.\"\n\nAlso just read an essay on mathematics and creativity --\n\nA Mathematician's Lament\n\n-- by Paul Lockhart -- a damning critique of the typical teaching of mathematics -- devoid of the recognition of its inherent creativity.  I want every teacher who teaches mathematics to read this and justify their current practices to me (says the indignant librarian).\n\nEverything he says rings true to me because I had a teacher like Paul Lockhart from 7th grade onwards in my little town in Maine.  Thank god for Wally Hayes and Ralph (Danny) Small.  They made mathematics come alive -- and made us exercise our mental creativity every day in the name of mathematics.  It was pure theater at times -- how Mr. Small would enthuse over a new proof he'd thought up the night before.  We believed him when he said he had the quadratic formula framed over his bedstead.  We never doubted that he spent his evenings reading mathematics books, enhanced by a bowl of potato chips and a glass of milk.\n\nHe never used labels for what he showed us -- he just showed us his thinking and encouraged us to show him ours.  I went off to college/university believing I'd never had calculus, because that word had never come up.  So I ended up repeating almost a whole year, not really knowing where Mr. Small had left off.  But I definitely recognized that what my college professor had to offer was lesser stuff -- it was all just \"cookbook\" mathematics, whereas I had been trained to do the real thing -- proofs and analysis and an underlying understanding all along, no matter whether I knew what the outside world called it or not.\n\nIn reading\n\nMalcolm Gladwell's \"Outliers\"\n\n-- and the luck of Bill Gates to have access to a computer in junior high in Washington state in 1967 or whenever it was -- I can't help but realize that I also was lucky.  It was 1972 when I was a freshman in high school that I got to program for the first time.  We had a time-share set-up with some computer in Portland and all of us had to write a computer program to solve the quadratic formula.  That meant creating an oiled punched-out tape that got fed into the remote reader and loaded into memory.  So at 15 I began my relationship with computers (okay, nowhere near the 10,000 deliberate practice hours of a Gates, but..).  Maybe it isn't so surprising that in 1980 I ended up in Boston at a software development company, despite my major in Russian Civilization. (I always used to say, languages are languages -- whether natural or mechanical.)\n\nAnyway, here's Paul Lockhart in full force on how math should be considered in the curriculum:\n\n\"The first thing to understand is that mathematics is an art.  The difference between math and the other arts, such as music and painting, is that our culture does not recognize it as such.\"\n\n\"A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns.  If his patterns are more permanet than theirs, it is because they are made with\n\nideas\n\n.\"  [G.H. Hardy]\n\n\"Mathematicians enjoy thinking about the simplest possible things, and the simplest possible things are imaginary.\"\n\n\"Mathematics is the art of explanation.  If you deny students the opportunity to engage in this activity.... you deny them mathematics itself.\"\n\n\"Math is not about following directions, it's about making new directions.\"\n\n\"A piece of mathematics is like a poem, and we can ask if it satisfies our aesthetic criteria:  Is this argument sound?  Does it make sense?   Is it simple and elegant?  Does it get me closer to the heart of the matter?\"\n\n\"Mathematics is the music of reason.\"\n\n\"The trouble is that math, like painting or poetry, is\n\nhard creative work\n\n.  That makes it very difficult to teach.  Mathematics is a slow, contemplative process.  It takes time to produce a work of art, and it takes a skilled teacher to recognize one.\"\n\n\"Teaching is not about information.  It's about having an honest intellectual relationshiop with your students.\"\n\n\"How ironic that people dismiss mathematics as the antithesis of creativity.  They are missing out on an art form older than any book, more profound than any poem, and more abstract that any abstract.\"\n\nImage credit:\n\ngadl via flickr",

      "content": "photo:\n\nMaggie Appleton\n\nRobert McKee\n\n, in his book\n\nStory: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting\n\n, presents\n\ncuriosity as the intellectual need to answer questions and close patterns\n\n-- a universal desire which story plays to by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.\n\nOlivia Judson, scientist and New York Times blogger\n\n, sees curiosity as the defining characteristic of the best scientists and as something that must be caught, not taught:\n\nIn schools, science is often taught as a body of knowledge — a set of facts and equations. But all that is just a consequence of scientific activity.\n\nScience itself is something else, something both more profound and less tangible. It is an attitude, a stance towards measuring, evaluating and describing the world that is based on skepticism, investigation and evidence.\n\nThe hallmark is curiosity; the aim, to see the world as it is.\n\nThis is not an attitude restricted to scientists, but it is, I think, more common among them. And it is not something taught so much as acquired during a training in research or by keeping company with scientists.\n\nRyszard Kapuscinski\n\n, the Polish journalist and author who died a couple of years ago, argues for this same centrality of curiosity for historians and journalists (who are really just current historians) -- exemplified by Herodotus.\n\nKapuscinski kept company with him by carrying around a copy of Herodotus's\n\nHistory\n\nthroughout his years as a foreign correspondent, and he describes the influence Herodotus had on him in his 2004 book,\n\nTravels with Herodotus\n\n(which I highly recommend as an introduction to either Kapuscinski or Herodotus).\n\nHere are snippets from the book:\n\nIn Herodotus's days, the Greek word \"history\" meant something more like \"investigation\" or \"inquiry\"\n\n.... [Herodotus] strove to find out, learn, and portray how history comes into being every day, how people create it, why its course oftens runs contrary to their efforts and expectations.\n\n[p. 257]\n\nWhat set him in motion?  Made him act? ....\n\nI think that it was simply curiosity about the world.  The desire to be there, to see it at any cost, to experience it no matter what.  It is actually a seldom encountered passion.\n\n[p. 258]\n\nTo be a conduit is their passion: therein lies their life mission.  To walk, ride, find out -- and proclaim it at once to the world.  There aren't many enthusiasts born.\n\nThe average person is not especially curious about the world..\n\n.. So when someone like Herodotus comes along -- a man possessed by a craving, a bug, a mania for knowledge, and endowed, furthermore, with intellect and powers of written expression -- it's not so surprising his rare existence should outlive him.\n\n[p. 267]\n\nSeth Godin\n\n, the business/marketing guru, has\n\na short video on the importance of being curious\n\n-- a desire to understand, a desire to try, a desire to push the envelope.  He also believes the curious are a minority and laments that the educational system does not (cannot?) promote it.\n\nCan curiosity be described as having an agile mind?\n\n(like Cliff Stoll in his\n\nTED talk \"18 Minutes with an Agile Mind\"\n\n)\n\nIs curiosity the skill of being interested in the world?\n\nRandy Nelson, dean of\n\nPixar\n\nUniversity, in\n\na short video on learning and working in the collaboration age\n\n(which is definitely worth watching), talks about Pixar looking for employees with four attributes:  1. Depth, 2. Breadth, 3. Communication, 4. Collaboration.\n\nNumber 2:  \"Breadth\" relates to being a curious person, though Nelson defines it as the skill of being interested.  He argues it's easy to find people who are interesting, but tough to find those who are more interested than interesting.  These are the people you want to talk to, he says, not because they're clever, but because they amplify \"me\", they want to know what I know -- they lean in when I talk and ask me questions.\n\nPixar is one of the companies highlighted in the book\n\nMavericks at Work: Why the Most Original Minds in Business Win\n\n-- by William C. Taylor & Polly LaBarre (2006).\n\nNelson is quoted there on the same subject:\n\n\"We've made the leap from an idea-centered business to a people-centered business.  Instead of developing ideas, we're developing people.  We're trying to create a culture of learning, filled with life-long learners.  It's no trick for talented people to be interesting, but it's a gift to be interested.  We want an organization filled with interested people.\"\n\n[p. 230]\n\nIsn't that what we all want?",

Here are my notes on\n\nan interview filmed with him in 2007\n\n.\n\nHis job is to \"oxygenate\" the New York Public Library -- to make the famous lions outside \"roar\" -- to create a library without walls.\n\nWe need to make people think it's sexy to think -- that there should be both information and inspiration.   We have to free the books.  To have a thought is to caress our brains.  Thinking is exciting!\n\nInspiration comes mainly from arguments around the kitchen table.  We need each other desperately as humans (e.g., you can't tickle yourself).  A library is a space of conviviality -- which can help us get references in common. We all need something to talk about.\n\nCuriosity is one of the most important things we can arm ourselves with in life -- if we're not curious at 20, we'll be boring at 50.  We must inspire curiosity -- to be interested in the world -- to have interests -- something to replenish our minds.\n\nThe blog\n\nDesign*Sponge\n\nhas done a couple of videos showing how a librarian at the\n\nNew York Public Library\n\nhas inspired five different artists -- a glassblower, a letterpress printer, a maker of ceramic dishes, etc. -- with material from the library's collection, whether images in books or artifacts themselves -- maps, old postcards, prints, etc.  See the videos on the NYPL webpage:\n\nDesign by the Book\n\n.\n\nSimilarly, Jay Walker is a man who believes a library should have objects to inspire -- as well as books.  There is a 7-minute TED video of him showing off some of the treasures in his amazing private library:\n\nJay Walker: A library of human imagination\n\n-- including an Enigma machine, a flag that's been to the moon and back, and a real Sputnik satellite.\n\nWired did an article on his library not long ago --\n\nBrowse the Artifacts of Geek History in Jay Walker's Library\n\n- with plenty of photos.  Go check it out.\n\nI'm going to end with a plug for the book I think should be in every library -- as a source of inspiration:\n\nAlan Fletcher\n\n's\n\nThe Art of Looking Sideways\n\n(2001), which has been described as \"the ultimate guide to visual awareness, a magical compilation that will entertain and inspire all those who enjoy the interplay between word and image, and who relish the odd and the unexpected. \"\n\nFletcher, a famous British graphic designer, is now dead, but here's a YouTube video of him talking about his unusual book.\n\nFlickr photo credits: lion:\n\nMacRonin47\n\n; library:\n\njamesjk\n\n;\n\nJay Walker library",

I often get my share early on a Saturday morning, thanks to Skype and Beth Gourley, my friend and fellow teacher-librarian.  When our video cameras come into focus, the difference in our locations is obvious.  Beth, up in Tianjin, China, at this time of year is wearing a thick bathrobe and huddled under a duvet, while I, down in Singapore, lounge in sleeveless nightwear, cooled by a ceiling fan.\n\nThis week's treasures from Beth included an article she wrote last year for\n\nKnowledgeQuest\n\ncalled\n\n\"Inquiry -- The Road Less Travelled\"\n\n(Vol. 37, No. 1, Sept/Oct 2008) and some related photos.  Unfortunately, the article is not yet available online, but should be eventually (and you could always write\n\nBeth\n\nand ask her to send you a copy.... )\n\nIn the article she describes the\n\nInternational School of Tianjin\n\n(an\n\nIBO\n\nschool) and how the teaching team there has worked on improving inquiry in the classrooms and library, starting with a group exploration of inquiry and information literacy models.\n\nThe result was a model adapted from three major sources:\n\nthe spiral of making personal meaning and understanding from Barbara Stripling (2003), guiding questions from Jennifer Branch and Dianne Oberg (2005), and language from Kath Murdoch (2005)\n\n.  The secondary school version is shown above, and they have\n\na similar one with simplified questions for the elementary school\n\n.\n\nI especially love how teachers use the model as a framework for documenting the units of inquiry.  Here is an example from one of their Kindergarten classes (click to enlarge):\n\nWhen Kath Murdoch came and worked with their teachers last year, they did a reflective exercise on their implementation of inquiry.  Here is a partial summary of the remarks collected (also taken from the article):\n\nThey go on to create the list (below left).\n\nNothing radical there -- everyone struggling to improve their inquiry will recognize the items as common goals.  Still it's good to be reminded of them.\n\nBeth is also working on a wiki called\n\nResearch Story\n\n, based on their inquiry model (which I trust she won't mind me sharing).  Like all wikis, it's a work in progress.  But I know it's made me want to go back and re-organize my own grade-level wikis around an inquiry model.\n\nNB: The inquiry cycle image at the top was developed at the International School of Tianjin (IST) in 2007.\n\nSources for the image compilation-- as taken from\n\nthe IST Flickr page\n\n:\n\nStripling, Barbara K.\n\n2003. “Inquiry-Based Learning.” In Curriculum Connections through the Library, ed.

      "content": "Research resources\n\n-- shared and organized in easily configured widgets/modules on tabbed pages --  that's what libraries using Web 2.0 tools like\n\nLibGuides\n\n,\n\nNetvibes\n\n, and\n\nPageflakes\n\ncan offer their customers.  It's one of the quickest ways to create a library portal or home page.\n\nLibGuides\n\nis not free, but it looks like it could be worth buying.\n\nCheck out\n\nthe LibGuides Community page\n\nwhere you can browse for academic, public, and school libraries and see how they have used the product.\n\nFor example, see the library guides created by:\n\nElizabeth Abarbanel and Karen Phillips\n\nat the Brentwood School (USA);\n\nBuffy Hamilton\n\nat Creekview High School (USA);\n\nThe Burlington County (public) Library\n\n(USA).\n\nBuffy (alias\n\nThe Unquiet Librarian\n\n) recently\n\nblogged about how much she loves LibGuides\n\nand she's someone who has been exploring the best means of providing students with research guides and pathfinders for some time now -- see her wiki:\n\nResearch Pathfinders 2.0: Information Streams for Students\n\n.\n\nNetvibes\n\nis the next best option -- and it's free.  This is what I've been playing with for the past few weeks, inspired by these librarians:\n\nShanghai Rego International School\n\n-- Primary Library -- by Fiona Collins\n\nDiscovery College Library\n\n-- Dianne MacKenzie in Hong Kong\n\nMy Bloomin' Web\n\n-- by Leanne Windsor at the Tokyo International School\n\n[URL updated 27/4/09]\n\nSt. Dominic's International School Junior Library\n\n-- by Yvonne Barrett in Portugal\n\nCampus des Nations Primary Library\n\n-- by Kathy Epps at the International School of Geneva\n\nCampus des Nations PYP Programme of Inquiry\n\n--also by Kathy Epps at the International School of Geneva\n\nThe beauty of Netvibes is that anything I see on any of their pages, I can easily copy to my own by simply clicking \"Share\" on a particular widget.  And everyone has both a private page and a public page, so you can play around with customizing widgets on your private page and then move them to the public sphere.\n\nFor example, I just copied over links to kids' magazines from Fiona, links on books and reading from Leanne, more book and reading links from Yvonne, links to audio book sites from Dianne, and dictionary websites from Kathy.\n\nI like how Kathy has made a separate page for the PYP units of inquiry -- and I'll be doing that as well, but for now here's\n\nmy initial effort\n\n:\n\nPageflakes is a similar tool that I have experimented with before, but then I recently read\n\na blog posting which suggested Pageflakes might die (from lack of funding)\n\n.  So I immediately began exploring Netvibes and was thrilled to find so many good library examples out there to copy.  But then just the other day there was\n\nan ominous blog posting about Netvibes!\n\nWell, I'm not giving up on Netvibes yet.  But as a form of insurance I've also just requested a proper LibGuides demo (and formal quote).  By the way, this is the official comment on costs:\n\nThe cost of an annual license depends on the size of your institution and the number of libraries involved. We try to customize the pricing for every client, to meet their specific needs (as well to fit within their budgets!). The annual license fee ranges from $899 to $2,999 ($549 for K-12 libraries). Most libraries would fall under the lower license range.\n\nContact us\n\nwith the info about your institution (FTE or # of card holders) and we'll give you an exact quote. Chances are, you'll be pleasantly surprised - LibGuides is a great deal, any way you look at it!\n\nI haven't mentioned iGoogle personalized pages, though they're quite similar.  You can also share widgets and tabs with other people, but they're designed more for personal homepages -- where someone is logged into their Google account.  So if your students all have iGoogle pages, then you could publicize library-specific widgets for them to add to their homepages.  And if you want to explore other options, see this\n\nlist of \"start page\" tools via Delicious\n\n.\n\nSpeaking of library websites, there are two I've admired recently for their clean \"Mac\" look and layout, though only\n\nLeanne's\n\nwas made on a Mac.\n\nThe other\n\nwas created using a free tool called\n\nWeebly\n\n.\n\np.s. Check out the\n\nscreencasts/tutorials\n\nThe Big House Library has made using\n\nJing\n\n(a free screen capture/screencast tool) showing how to use their library catalog (Follett's Destiny). I plan to do the same (someday).",

      "content": "Back in early January\n\nKeri-Lee Beasley\n\n, the ICT teacher, and I started\n\nan optional Web 2.0 professional development initiative for staff\n\nat our new little campus (400 students K1 through Grade 4)- copying the very successful and widespread\n\n23 Things\n\nmovement in libraries (see\n\nthis background summary\n\nand\n\nall these Delicious bookmarks tagged \"23things\"\n\n, if you've never heard of it).\n\nOur pre-assessment was an\n\nonline survey\n\nasking about our teachers' familiarity -- either\n\nNever heard of\n\n/\n\nHave heard of\n\n/\n\nHave used\n\n/ or\n\nUse regularly\n\n-- with a wide range of \"things\" like social bookmarking, blogs, wikis, RSS, Twitter, photo sharing, screen capture tools, podcasts, avatars, Skype, Google Docs, etc. (as well as some software the school subscribes to -- like StudyWiz, Atomic Learning, United Streaming, etc.).\n\nThe results\n\nwere quite revealing, especially as we had little knowledge of the existing digital literacy of our staff, this being the first year of a start-up school.  (Note:\n\nthe results for our counterparts\n\nat the other campus were similarly interesting.)\n\nOur goal was to increase awareness of what's available online to improve teachers' personal/professional productivity and enhance their teaching.   We could only tempt people to try new things -- hopefully stretching/scaffolding them to increase their ability to take more responsibility for their own Web n.0 learning. (It would be a bit ambitious to say we were aiming for the\n\nISTE Educational Technology Standards for Teachers\n\n.)\n\nI have never liked the\n\ndigital native vs. digital immigrant\n\ndistinction, as it privileges the accident of birth -- and I don't think age is the critical factor.\n\nDigital tourists vs. digital residents\n\nwould be more appropriate.  However, as a librarian I prefer a comparison with how people become an avid reader.\n\nThe \"Magic Bullet\" theory of reading\n\nsays the right book at the right time can turn a non-reader into a lifelong reader.  Sometimes all it takes is a strong recommendation or taste of a genre to become smitten.\n\nBecoming an avid online learner is similar.  For some people it happens quite easily, while others are still waiting for the \"Magic Bullet\" -- the right tool at the right time -- in order to understand the power of the experience.  So, in selecting \"things\" (or Web 2.0 genres) for our Connecting East initiative and recommending examples to have a look at, Keri-Lee and I were hoping to expose our teachers to potential \"Magic Bullets\".\n\nA recent\n\narticle in Innovate\n\nidentifies the progression of a 21st century online learner as first\n\nto link\n\n, then\n\nto lurk\n\n, and then\n\nto lunge\n\n.  In deciding what we could -- and should -- cover in 10 assignments, Keri-Lee and I basically set out a similar path for our participants while offering four levels of differentiation:\n\nNovice\n\n/\n\nApprentice\n\n/\n\nPractitioner\n\n/\n\nExpert\n\nFor example, we began with\n\nsocial bookmarking\n\n(i.e., linking), as 44% of our target audience had never heard of sites like\n\nDelicious\n\nand\n\nDiigo\n\n.  Later we suggested\n\nblogs to read\n\n(i.e., lurking) and ways to\n\ncollect their own personal learning online\n\n(i.e., lunging).  Other assignments included more prosaic skills, like manipulating/creating images and using interactive whiteboards.  See\n\nour Connecting East wiki\n\nfor an overview.  (NB: The links in red on the wiki sidebar also show what we\n\ndidn\n\n't manage to fit in or get around to.)\n\nE-mail\n\nwas used to announce a new topic, introduced via a\n\nConnecting East\n\nblog\n\nposting, with task details described on a\n\nConnecting East\n\nwiki\n\npage -- plus weekly face-to-face time on\n\n\"Fruity Fridays\"\n\nwhere we were available before school in the joint library/ICT lab to answer questions, with breakfast fruit on offer as an incentive.\n\nIt's not over yet -- the last assignment goes out today -- a reflective exercise, of which this blog post is part.  Participants then have until early June to complete all tasks to qualify for a prize draw of an iPod, wine, or books.\n\nBut has it been worthwhile?  Yes, definitely -- at least for me and Keri-Lee.  In fact, it's been a good example of\n\nmeaningful work\n\n, which\n\nMalcolm Gladwell\n\nin\n\nOutliers\n\ndefines by the qualities of\n\nautonomy\n\n,\n\ncomplexity\n\n, and\n\na connection between effort and reward\n\n.  It's also been a case of\n\ncollaborative fun\n\n-- for which my role model is\n\nDan Ariely\n\n; I just read his book\n\nPredictably Irrational\n\nand I was struck by how many colleagues he regularly collaborates with in setting up his quirky experiments in behavioral economics.  Keri-Lee and I put just as much time and thought into setting up the Connecting East experiences for our colleagues and analyzing the results -- and had (almost) as much fun as Ariely and his friends.\n\nIf our own learning has been the greatest reward so far, it's less certain how much others have gained.  We have seen definite glimmers, but the uptake hasn't been as high as we, of course, would like.\n\nWhich reminds me of the advice:\n\nDon't water rocks...\n\nBe thankful for the teachers who did take us up on our offer and who have tried something new, whether it's starting to bookmark, to Twitter, or to play with Netvibes -- and put more energy into them.  After all, it takes time for someone to turn into an avid reader/learner.\n\nNetworked teacher image via\n\nlangwitches @ Flickr\n\nRock image via\n\njasohill @ Flickr\n\nWine image via\n\nJoe Pitz @ Flickr\n\niPod image via\n\nAndrew* @ Flickr\n\nBooks image via\n\nlibrarybug @ Flickr\n\nButterfly bullet image via\n\nrazZziel @ Flickr",

It’s what we can do with information that is changing things.\"\n\n(2008)\n\n\"... embracing tools that give all their student-learners and teacher-learners ubiquitous access to networked, digital, and abundant information — and the capacity to work that information and express discoveries and outcomes compellingly to authentic audiences.\"\n\n(2009)\n\nInformation\n\n&\n\nDigital\n\nLite\n\nracies also nicely combines the main characteristic of our respective subject areas -- me as the Teacher-Librarian and Keri-Lee as the ICT Facilitator.\n\nWhat's new this year besides recognition of us as a team?\n\nOne, Keri-Lee is no longer an ICT \"teacher\" on a release-time, weekly fixed schedule with classes; instead she's a facilitator on a flexi-schedule, collaborating with classroom teachers on different units of inquiry, as I have been.\n\nTwo, we're using the\n\nISTE\n\nNETS for Students\n\nas our roadmap and are working on a document for our teachers, translating the\n\nNETS Profiles\n\ninto\n\npossible experiences/scenarios\n\nfor our students based on our curriculum and taking the\n\nIBO PYP\n\nTransdisciplinary Skills (Communication, Research, Thinking, Self-Management, and Social) into account. In addition, we're looking at the NETS  for\n\nTeachers\n\n,\n\nAdministrators\n\n, and\n\nTechnology Facilitators\n\n.\n\nThree, we have some new technology toys, which teachers can book, just like they can book us:  a set of\n\niPod Touches\n\nand a set of\n\nvideo cameras\n\n.\n\nIn celebration of this shift, Keri-Lee and I attended the\n\n21st Century Learning @ Hong Kong: Extending Tomorrow's Leaders with Digital Learning\n\n, held September 17-19, 2009, at\n\nHong Kong International School (HKIS)\n\n.\n\nWith over 500 attendees, many of us from overseas, there was a good mix of teachers (a lot of IT/ICT, but also librarians and others) - and\n\nthe program\n\nhad plenty to offer.\n\n(NB: I presented a workshop with\n\nBeth Gourley\n\n, from the\n\nIn\n\nternational School of Tianjin\n\n, called\n\nDigital Gist\n\n:\n\nHarnessing digital content for learning and the library:\n\nan inquiry into texts online in audio, video, and e-book formats\n\n.)\n\nOne of the most useful sessions Keri-Lee and I attended, in terms of our goals for our own school, was\n\nWalking the Talk: 21st Century Learning in Curriculum Design and Learning\n\nby\n\nGreg Curtis\n\n, Curriculum Director at the\n\nInternational School of Beijing\n\n(ISB).\n\nHe started off with this video (from\n\nThe Onion\n\n) re the \"21st century skills\" our kids are going to need.\n\nGreg stressed that the 21st century movement (yes, they do use the term at ISB) is a learning one, not a technology one -- and therefore needs to be driven by the curriculum unit, not the IT department -- that it's about strategic planning and future visioning, not IT planning.  (Read: management buy-in is critical.)\n\nAt ISB they are trying to create a \"pull\" culture, rather than a \"push\" one -- to infuse technology into learning experiences and explorations, not force it.  A culture where technology is expected to be used and will be drawn in.  Never technology for its own sake.  Context is everything.  It's all about the learning -- always about the learning.\n\nHe walked us through ISB's\n\nLea\n\nrning 21\n\nframework -- with\n\nStandards\n\nin the center, then moving out a ring to the Learning 21\n\nApproaches\n\n, and then the outer ring of Learning 21\n\nSkills\n\n.  (I was pleased to learn they had blended the library and technology standards.)\n\nAll these are incorporated, along with\n\nUnderstanding by Design\n\nconstructs, into their Curriculum Mapping system, which allows them to visually check the spread of assessment tasks and see how the Learn 21 Approaches and Skills are being integrated.\n\nTo implement this program, ISB has initiated an early release afternoon on Wednesdays, providing two hours a week of concentrated staff professional development time.\n\nWhat a tremendous commitment to a program and a process.  I look forward to following ISB's progress over the next few years.\n\nSee Greg's handout\n\n- scanned and uploaded to Google Docs\n\nSee also my rough notes on his presentation\n\n- in Google Docs\n\n(By the way, I was pleased to see Sharon Vipond, the secondary librarian at HKIS, has posted\n\nher notes on all the keynote speeches\n\nfrom the conference.)\n\nIt was such a beneficial and collaborative exercise attending the conference together with Keri-Lee -- we were continually bouncing impressions and ideas off each other.  We'll see how we get on with our own integrated standards, approaches, and skills initiative -- and our efforts to infuse information and digital literacy into our East campus classrooms.\n\nAnd hats off to the conference organizers -- it was a well-executed event and I would definitely attend it again.",

      "content": "Clay\n\ndoesn't stop.   Luckily the blog entry he just wrote --\n\n“You Suck at Photoshop”: Paragon of Creative Project-Based Learning\n\n-- fits in perfectly with where I want to continue from\n\nmy last post\n\n(which was spurred by a previous post of his:\n\nBarbarians with Laptops\n\n).\n\nIt's about the importance of narrative in the teaching/learning process.\n\nOkay,\n\nYou Suck at Photoshop\n\nisn't \"a grand narrative\" (one of the three essential elements of teaching according to Michael Wesch (see my\n\nprevious post\n\n)). But the format could be used to help convey one, incorporating \"disciplinary knowledge\" into a funny story with a good hook. And Clay showed us an example of a teacher, Lynn Hunt of UCLA -- a \"sage on the stage\" -- presenting a compelling introduction to the Enlightenment -- by telling us a good story. It's \"chalk and talk\" but effective. (See his blog post:\n\nNew Tech Teaching Habits\n\n.)\n\nThe power of storytelling is often lost in the\n\nongoing debates\n\nover:\n\nteacher-centered vs. student-centered learning\n\ncontent vs. process focus\n\ntraditional vs. progressive\n\n\"sage on the stage\" vs. \"guide on the side\"\n\ndisciplinary knowledge vs. 21st century skills\n\nTwo theorists who consider storytelling at the constant heart of intelligence and teaching and learning are\n\nRoger Schank\n\nand\n\nKieran Egan\n\n. Both have been around for a long time and are still producing work, e.g., see:\n\nKieran Egan's 2009 book,\n\nThe Future of Education\n\n- as well as\n\nLearning in Depth: A simple innovation that can transform schooling\n\n, due out from the University of Chicago Press in 2010;\n\nRoger Schank's upcoming book,\n\nCognition! Teaching Kids to Think\n\n(see\n\nthe first four chapters\n\nhe's made available on his website)\n\n-- and both deserve wider audiences, if only as interesting voices from the margins to test your own ideas against.\n\nRoger Schank\n\nThe best historical introduction to\n\nRoger Schank\n\nis probably\n\nvia the Edge.org website\n\n.  You might read his article\n\n\"Information is Surprises\"\n\n(1995).  Especially note the comments by other people at the end -- re him, not that article.  I particularly like this one:\n\nW. Daniel Hillis:\n\nThe Roger Schank I knew was a thorn in everybody's side — constructively so. The interesting thing about Roger Schank, something he shares with Minsky, is the fact that he's produced an incredible string of students. Anybody who's produced such a great string of students has to be a constructive pain in the ass. He's always taken an adversarial stance in his theories. He doesn't just say, \"Here's my theory.\" He says, \"Here's why I'm right and everybody else is an idiot.\" He's often right.\n\nOkay, now that you're primed for someone quite opinionated\n\n(I like that phrase: \"a constructive pain the ass\"...)\n\n, go watch this Jan 2009 video, filmed in Barcelona where he is helping to open a new\n\nInstitute for the Learning Sciences\n\n(as part of their Business Engineering program*) -- based on a\n\nStory-Centered Curriculum\n\n.  He goes through everything wrong with existing schools and describes his ideal school:\n\nIn summary:\n\n\"Every curriculum should tell a story... and the story should be one that tells what the life of the future practitioner is like (and it should involve lots of practice).\"\n\nAs he says, teaching doesn't mean talking -- people aren't good at listening -- we listen to be entertained, not to learn. Learning happens as a result of being hooked by good stories -- and by practicing goal-based scenarios that are fun or obviously useful.\n\nHere are my notes on Roger Schank's  1999 book,\n\nTell Me a Story: Narrative and Intelligence\n\n, a thought-provoking read for teacher-librarians as it's about stories, learning, and information retrieval (out of the brain, not the internet) --and so relates to fiction, non-fiction, and tagging/cataloging.\n\n(\n\nGoogle Books\n\nmakes a lot of the book available online, as well as the foreword by the literary critic Gary Saul Morson.)\n\nTeaching is the right story at the right time.\n\nGood stories with lots of information allow listeners to derive their own conclusions.\n\nWe do not remember a whole story, but only the gist, indexed in different ways.\n\nListening is hard -- stories usually just trigger stories back and forth -- how does new learning occur?\n\nCreativity is the adaptation of old stories to new purposes -- it arises not from the void, but from the drawer. And the drawer is only full by virtue of intelligent indexing over time -- the collecting of lots of stories in the brain. Understanding is the process of index extraction -- figuring out what story to tell.\n\nFind an anomaly -- ask a question -- get a story. Anomalies are when we don't know the answer. When we have no story to tell, we look for one -- by asking ourselves questions.\n\nCuriosity is about recognizing anomalies and having the ability to take pleasure in exploring them, which leads us to the value of the search process itself and to prefer answers that lead to ever more questions.\n\nOr as Schank says on page 231:\n\n\"Learning to explain phenomena such that one continues to be fascinated by the failure of one's explanations creates a continuing cycle of thinking that is the crux of intelligence.\"\n\nRe the failure to listen to failure, see this recent Wired article  -\n\nAccept Defeat: The Neuroscience of Screwing Up\n\n. The importance of having a broad input of stories -- and a broad audience -- is highlighted:\n\nWhen Dunbar reviewed the transcripts of the meeting, he found that\n\nthe intellectual mix generated a distinct type of interaction\n\nin which\n\nthe scientists were forced to rely on metaphors and analogies to express themselves\n\n. (That’s because, unlike the\n\nE. coli\n\ngroup, the second lab lacked a specialized language that everyone could understand.) These abstractions proved essential for problem-solving, as they encouraged the scientists to reconsider their assumptions.\n\nHaving to explain the problem to someone else forced them to think, if only for a moment, like an intellectual on the margins, filled with self-skepticism\n\n.\n\n[\n\nbold\n\nadded]\n\nThis is similar to something a former PhD student said about what he learned from Schank (quoted by Schank in his\n\nfour-chapter preview\n\nof his upcoming book:\n\nYou taught me that often our theories get so complex that it takes a specialist with years of training to understand them.    When we get our theories this distant from everyday life and everyday people, it is awkward explaining what we do when in conversation with our family, friends, the press, and even upper level executives, etc.\n\nYou taught me to test to see if what you are doing matters and is of interest to the everyday person seeking distraction and some entertainment, but not entirely brain dead, with some curiosity left about life and what others think.\n\nIn other words, can you make an interesting story out of it?\n\nKieran Egan\n\nKieran Egan\n\nargues that students have access to plenty of information - the problem is getting it into them and getting it to mean anything to them.   Knowledge exists only in people, in living tissue in our bodies; what exists in libraries and computers are only codes or externally stored symbolic material.\n\nThis is where powerful stories and metaphors come in -- as tools to engage students' imagination and emotions in learning about the world.\n\nEgan insists that students' imaginations can only work with what they know, so a great deal of content knowledge is required.  He's an advocate of students becoming experts, e.g., by studying one topic throughout their whole school career (in addition to the usual curriculum). (See his new\n\nLearning in Depth\n\nproject.)\n\nStorytelling fits into Egan's larger framework of cognitive tools and theory of\n\nImaginative Education\n\n. These cognitive tools are the things that enable our brains to do cultural work -- and he likens to operating systems or programs in the brain, forms of which are running at all times in varying degrees at all ages: the\n\nSomatic\n\n(the body & its senses), the\n\nMythic\n\n(oral language), the\n\nRomantic\n\n(reading and writing), the\n\nPhilosophic\n\n(the meta-narrative of systems in the world), and the\n\nIronic\n\n(multiple perspectives in the mind at one time).\n\nFor more details on Egan's framework, see\n\nThe Educated Mind: how cognitive tools shape our understanding\n\n(1997);  for a more practical guide to his storytelling ideas for younger students, see his\n\nTeaching as Storytelling: an alternative approach to teaching and curriculum in the elementary school\n\n(1986).\n\nEgan defines education as \"the process in which we maximize the tool kit we individually take from the external storehouse of culture.\"  For me, libraries (whether physical or virtual) are primary portals to that cultural storehouse.  (As they say, knowledge is free at the library -- bring your own container.)  And librarians are there with embodied knowledge to help people find the right story at the right time.\n\nMore on Storytelling and Metaphors\n\nVivian Gussin Paley\n\nand her books are all about storytelling with young children -- and how\n\nstory and play are inextricable in the learning process\n\n(which will be the topic of my next post -- stories, serious play and disciplinary knowledge)\n\nThese next ones are NOT specifically re education and you probably know most of them, but they're some of my favorite examples of storytelling and metaphors.\n\nTED talks that exemplify a great story:\n\nSherwin Nuland on electroshock therapy\n\nand\n\nJill Bolte Taylor's stroke of insight\n\n-- and a TED talk that gives a great example of being taught how to tell a story at a young age:\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin\n\nRandy Pausch's Last Lecture: on achieving your childhood dreams\n\nPostSecret -\n\neach postcard is the tip of an iceberg of a story - (I can't help but think some were created as an exercise by a budding novelist...)\n\nThe Moth podcasts\n\n-- true stories told live on stage with no notes or props\n\nTwo connected books:\n\nExercises in Style\n\n(1947) by Raymond Queneau, and its modern counterpart:\n\n99 Ways to Tell a Story\n\n(2005) by Matt Madden\n\nTED talk: James Geary, metaphorically speaking\n\nGeorge Lakoff\n\nis the expert on metaphors as far as I'm concerned - his\n\nMetaphors We Live By\n\n(1980) (co-authored with Mark Johnson) is the place to start, but don't stop there....\n\nSpeaking of metaphors, I can't help but throw in Stephen Colbert and Sean Penn on April 19, 2007 competing in the\n\nMeta-Free-Phor-All: Shall I Nail Thee to a Summer's Day?\n\nThe Colbert Report\n\nMon - Thurs 11:30pm / 10:30c\n\nMeta-Free-Phor-All: Shall I Nail Thee to a Summer's Day?\n\nwww.colbertnation.com\n\nColbert Report Full Episodes\n\nPolitical Humor\n\nEconomy\n\nLast but not least, the metaphor I use to introduce information overload and the need for smart searching on the internet:\n\nImage via\n\nWill Lion\n\non Flickr\n\n* re business schools, there's\n\na debate in the NYTimes re the appropriate metaphor for how universities (especially business schools) treat students\n\n- as customers? as products?

      "content": "Clay Burell\n\nhas been on a writing binge over the holiday -- and there have been long conversations in the comments of several posts, which, as Clay put it, have been the equivalent of college-level credit in terms of professional development. NB: Some of my contributions are re-formatted and expanded below.\n\nFirst of all, see the original\n\nBeyond School\n\nblog posts (among others):\n\nBarbarians with Laptops: An Unreasonable Fear?\n\nOn Using Technology Without Understanding It\n\nWhy “Academic Excellence” No Longer Cuts It Today\n\nVideos: Mental Poverty, Collaboration, “Recession Skills 101″\n\nClay expressed his fear that we are producing\n\nbarbarians with laptops\n\nand challenged people to to provide good examples of learning that effectively enhanced content and the development of important skills -- and many did. (Check out the responses of Roberto Greco, Monika Hardy, Neil Stephenson,  Hellen Harding, et al.)\n\nI cited\n\nMichael Wesch's philosophy of teaching outlined in a video\n\nin 2008 as my guiding light.\n\nIn summary, to create students who make meaningful connections we need to\n\nfind a grand narrative and provide context and relevance\n\n(i.e., semantic meaning);\n\ncreate a learning environment that values and leverages learners themselves\n\n(i.e., personal meaning); and\n\ndo both in a way that realizes and leverages the existing media environment\n\nTechnology isn’t an end in itself -- it’s about leverage in the service of meaningful connections. So if it doesn't enhance the learning in the classroom and it's not authentic participation in the existing media environment (read: busywork), you shouldn't feel obliged to use it.\n\nCliff Stoll\n\nis someone who comes down squarely against computers in the classroom.  See his 1999 book,\n\nHigh-Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian\n\n-- as well as\n\nhis Feb. 2006 TED talk\n\n(which provides an excellent preview of how he would perform as a teacher in a classroom).\n\n(And if you want an example of what it means to be a ruthless and natural inquirer, read his 1989 book\n\nThe Cuckoo's Egg: tracking a spy through the maze of computer espionage\n\n.)\n\nHere he is talking about computers in classrooms -- from\n\nan interview in 2000\n\n:\n\nStoll\n\n: The one thing that computers do extraordinarily well is bring information to kids. Computers give kids access to vast amounts of information.\n\nEW\n\n: Don't computers have a place in the classroom, then, if merely as a source of information?\n\nStoll\n\n: Is a lack of information a problem in schools? I've never once had a teacher say to me \"I don't have enough information.\" Teachers say they don't have enough time. The problem in classrooms is not a lack of information. It's too much information.\n\n......\n\nStoll\n\n: ... The problem is that the use of computers subtracts from the student-to-teacher contact hours. It directs attention away from the student-teacher relationship and directs it toward the student-computer relationship. It teaches students to focus on getting information rather than on exploring and creating. Which is more interactive -- a student and a teacher or a student and a computer? ...\n\nRe the love inherent in classroom teaching and the importance of time with a teacher (technology aside), I can't help but re-recommend a commencement address by\n\nMargaret Edson, teacher and playwright\n\n.\n\nThere's a link in this blog post\n\n(skip the first 3 min of her talk and get to the heart of it).\n\nUmberto Eco in this interview\n\nalso brings up the problem of too much information, but sees the teacher (in the role of master to apprentices) as instrumental in dealing with it.\n\nEco\n\n: ... These [Google] lists can be dangerous -- not for old people like me, who have acquired their knowledge in another way, but for young people, for whom Google is a tragedy. Schools ought to teach the high art of how to be discriminating.\n\nSPIEGEL\n\n: Are you saying that teachers should instruct students on the difference between good and bad? If so, how should they do that?\n\nEco\n\n: Education should return to the way it was in the workshops of the Renaissance. There, the masters may not necessarily have been able to explain to their students why a painting was good in theoretical terms, but they did so in more practical ways. Look, this is what your finger can look like, and this is what it has to look like. Look, this is a good mixing of colors. The same approach should be used in school when dealing with the Internet. The teacher should say: \"Choose any old subject, whether it be German history or the life of ants. Search 25 different Web pages and, by comparing them, try to figure out which one has good information.\" If 10 pages describe the same thing, it can be a sign that the information printed there is correct. But it can also be a sign that some sites merely copied the others' mistakes.\n\nLast year Clay Shirky pointed out\n\nIt's Not Information Overload, It's Filter Failure\n\n.\n\nIn that light, Umberto Eco is proposing teachers as human filters** for disciplinary knowledge and practices, teaching students to discriminate.\n\nFrank Schirrmacher\n\nrecognizes this same need to question what we're consuming in the way of information.\n\nHe talks about humans as ''informavores\" in this video/transcript:\n\nEdge In Frankfurt: THE AGE OF THE INFORMAVORE— A Talk with Frank Schirrmacher\n\n.\n\nI think it's very interesting, the concept — again, Daniel Dennett and others said it — the concept of the informavores, the human being as somebody eating information. So you can, in a way, see that the Internet and that the information overload we are faced with at this very moment has a lot to do with food chains, has a lot to do with food you take or not to take, with food which has many calories and doesn't do you any good, and with food that is very healthy and is good for you. ....\n\nAs we know, information is fed by attention, so we have not enough attention, not enough food for all this information. And, as we know — this is the old Darwinian thought, the moment when Darwin started reading Malthus — when you have a conflict between a population explosion and not enough food, then Darwinian selection starts. And Darwinian systems start to change situations. And so what interests me is that we are, because we have the Internet, now entering a phase where Darwinian structures, where Darwinian dynamics, Darwinian selection, apparently attacks ideas themselves: what to remember, what not to remember, which idea is stronger, which idea is weaker.\n\nIt's the question: what is important, what is not important, what is important to know? Is this information important? Can we still decide what is important? And it starts with this absolutely normal, everyday news.\n\nHaving introduced the metaphor of information as food, I can't help but end with a link to one of the essays David Brooks gave a\n\n2009 Sidney (best essay) award\n\nto:\n\nIs Food the New Sex? - Mary Eberhardt - Hoover Institution - Policy Review\n\nTry reading it, substituting the word \"\n\ninformation\n\n\" for \"\n\nfood\n\n\" or \"\n\nsex\n\n\"....\n\nThese disciplines imposed historically on access to food and sex now raise a question that has not come up before, probably because it was not even possible to imagine it until the lifetimes of the people reading this:\n\nWhat happens when, for the first time in history — at least in theory, and at least in the advanced nations — adult human beings are more or less free to have all the sex and food they want?\n\nThis question opens the door to a real paradox. For given how closely connected the two appetites appear to be, it would be natural to expect that people would do the same kinds of things with both appetites — that they would pursue both with equal ardor when finally allowed to do so, for example, or with equal abandon for consequence; or conversely, with similar degrees of discipline in the consumption of each.\n\nIn fact, though, evidence from the advanced West suggests that nearly the  opposite seems to be true. The answer appears to be that when many people are  faced with these possibilities for the very first time, they end up doing very  different things —\n\nthings we might signal by shorthand as mindful eating, and mindless sex.\n\nThis  essay is both an exploration of that curious dynamic, and a speculation about  what is driving it.\n\n[\n\nbold\n\nadded]\n\nHere we are, for the first time in history with all the information we want.  It's the \"Informavore's Dilemma\" ***.  Now we just need to develop the discipline for\n\nmindful information consumption\n\n.\n\n** Social bookmarking is a form of  discriminating filtering and\n\nRoberto Greco, with over 17,500 bookmarks on Delicious\n\nis one of my richest human filters for reading material.  As a librarian, I'm impressed with both his descriptions and his tags.\n\n*** I thought I was being clever  vis-a-vis\n\nMichael Pollan's book \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\"\n\n, but Google tells me\n\nfindability.org\n\nused it first...\n\np.s. Wherever I've used the word \"teacher\", I obviously include \"librarians\".\n\nImage of Umberto Eco via\n\ngiveawayboy\n\non Flickr / Image of bento box via\n\nCowism\n\n/ Image of Google log via\n\nthe Telegraph UK",

      "content": "\"Building literate communities\"\n\nand  \"\n\nSupporting the digital education agenda\n\n\"\n\nwere two of the four strands of  the\n\nIASL / SLAQ (Int'l Assoc. of School Librarianship / School Library Assoc. of Queensland) 2010 conference\n\nheld in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Sep. 27 - Oct. 1.\n\nOver the course of the week the two themes merged into an essential question for me:\n\nHow to build\n\ndigitally\n\nliterate communities\n\n?\n\nOur school is embarking on a\n\n\"21st Century Teaching & Learning\" program\n\n(aka\n\niLearn\n\n) over the next two years, part of which will involve going 1:1 with Apple laptops in Grade 6 and above (and 2:1 below that) -- and designing new library/information spaces.\n\nPresentations by two academics - one an education/business/think-tank professor and the other a education/futurist -- gave me some interesting concepts and phrases to play with -- re people and spaces that will support the digitally literate community we want to become.\n\nMichael Hough\n\n, Professorial Fellow at the Univ. of Wollongong -- Keynote: \"\n\nIn Schools that Face the Future, Libraries Matter\n\n\" -- & Session: \"\n\nThe Role of the Teacher-Librarian in Developing Leadership Capabilities in Staff\n\n\"\n\nErica McWilliam\n\n, co-leader of the Creative Workforce Program at Queensland University of Technology -- Keynote:\n\n\"High Standards or a High Standard of Standardness?\"\n\n>>>\n\nSee a vodcast and accompanying slideshow for each keynote\n\n<<<\n\nBoth explored the e-learning shift underway and confirmed the need for\n\n21st Century Teacher-Librarians\n\n(see\n\nJoyce  Valenza's Manifesto for the definitive description of one\n\n), with Hough claiming librarians should become the C.I.O. (Chief Information Officer) of their schools.\n\nHe highly recommended the recently published book --\n\nDeveloping a Networked School Community\n\n-- and cited Chapter 9 (most of which you can read via\n\nGoogleBooks\n\n) by\n\nLyn Hay\n\n(who was one of my online professors -- I wrote a paper on\n\nGaming in Education\n\nfor her back in 2005...)\n\n.\n\nHough particularly liked her concept of the\n\niCentre\n\n, which she defines as\n\n\"the central facility within the school where information, technology, learning and teaching needs are supported by qualified information and learning technology specialists.  It is a centre that provides students and teachers with a one-stop shop for all resourcing, technology, and learning needs on a daily basis.\"\n\n(See also the slides from a recent keynote by Hay: \"\n\n21st  Century Teacher-Librarian: Rethink, Rebuild, and Re-brand\n\n\".)\n\nMcWilliam provided an interesting variation on the idea, by surveying the culture of the coffee house from raucous 17th century London up until erudite 20th century Vienna.  A home away from home, a place you want to go to. She argued Hogarth's coffee house was an antecedent of the lifelong learning space -- a round table of communal resources (both liquid and intellectual) -- and that librarians would benefit from considering the various skills and dispositions of those distant coffee house landlords (arbiter, assembler, gossip provider, business manager, service manager, social broker of relationships, etc) over time.\n\nShe suggested today's online model might be nings, an iCafe for shared passions. I think Twitter is a fitter descendant.\n\n#slaqiasl2010\n\nwas the Twitter tag for the conference -- and others in my personal learning network were far more adept at typing up the passing thoughts (special thanks to\n\nStacey Taylor\n\n,\n\nMarita Thomson\n\n, and\n\nJessica Jorna\n\nfor their quick minds and fingers. You allowed me to concentrate on my own more expansive note-taking.)\n\nThe whole conference was a community experience, with an overlapping of school librarians, international school librarians, IBO school librarians, and academics.\n\nIn line with the same \"building communities\" theme, Barb Philip, the junior school teacher-librarian at Tanglin Trust School here in Singapore, and I did a presentation on \"\n\nBuilding Internationally Literate Communities\n\n\", based on our library network's efforts to expand the reading experiences of our students.\n\nMore blog posts re learning and connections made at the conference to follow...",

      "content": "As part of a self-study accreditation process, our school has invited staff to consider the question of what\n\nlearning\n\nis -- for three hours on a Saturday morning.  Reps from each grade/area should be in attendance -- and each person is asked to bring along a book, article, or reference.  I know what mine will be.\n\nEngaging Minds: changing teaching in complex times\n\n-- 2nd ed, 2008 -- by Brent Davis, Dennis Sumara, and Rebecca Luce-Kapler.\n\nHere are some bits.... taken from\n\nmy notes\n\n.....\n\nLearning is about becoming attentive to things you never noticed before -- becoming conscious -- becoming aware.\n\nTeachers play a pivotal role in orientating attentions in ways that prompt transformations in personal perception and consciousness -- helping people to notice what they haven't noticed.\n\nEducation is not about compelling others to see the world in the ways we see it, but in terms of expanding the space of the possible.\n\nThe notion of shared labor -- social learning -- highlighting how complex knowing is distributed across a web of individuals.\n\nThe learner is the collective.  Knowledge cannot exist independent of the knower -- it is a potential to action both embodied and situated.  Bodies know, and that's what makes them part of grander knowing bodies.  Knowledge, then is about relationship.\n\nThe metaphor of the teacher as \"the consciousness of the collective\" -- expanding the space of the possible and \"creating conditions for the emergence of the as-yet unimagined\".\n\nPrompting change or learning is a matter of disequilibrium.... with the teacher in the middle, mediating, mentoring -- giving voice and advocating... opening up spaces for collective action, not defining the action.\n\nTeaching is not about what the teacher does, it's about what happens to the learner.\n\nLearning is complex, full of recursive elaboration... iterative processes and nested systems.\n\n\"A complexified conception of curriculum would suggest an image more like a phase space or a fractal tree, in which each event opens up new possibilities for action, which in turn open still other divergent possibilities.  There is no particular direction -- except, perhaps, toward the expansion of the space of the possible.\"\n\nA teacher is constantly perturbed and being perturbed.\n\nTeaching is an event that prompts a complex system to respond differently.\n\nThe lesson plan is a thought experiment.\n\nI'm fascinated with the idea of the unknown unknowns*.  E.g., see\n\nmy blog post on Roger Schank\n\n.  His definition of learning bears repeating:\n\n\"Learning to explain phenomena such that one continues to be fascinated by the failure of one's explanations creates a continuing cycle of thinking that is the crux of intelligence.\"\n\nPiaget said intelligence is what is called on when an agent doesn't know what to do, i.e., discerning what really matters in a situation.\n\nKarl Hostetler, a professor interested in both philosophy and education -- (download\n\na PDF of his article << What is \"Good\" Education Research?>> (2005)\n\n),  quotes Hans-Georg Gadamer (1960/1989) :\n\n\"Knowledge always means, precisely, considering opposites.  Its superiority over preconceived opinion consists in the fact that is able to conceive of possibilities as possibilities.... [So] only a person who has questions can have knowledge. [However] there is no such thing as a method of learning to ask questions, of learning to see what is questionable.  On the contrary, the example of Socrates teaches that\n\nthe important thing is the knowledge that one does not know\n\n.\"\n\nThis potential knowledge is what we as teachers must value -- in ourselves as much as in our students.\n\nErrol Morris, the documentary filmmaker, did a 5-part series of articles on knowing and unknowing in the NYT earlier this year --\n\n\"The Anosognosic's Dilemma:  Something's Wrong but You'll Never Know What It Is\" (Part I)\n\n-- in which he interviews David Dunning, a professor who is known for his elaboration of the\n\nDunning-Kruger effect\n\n, which is when our incompetence masks our ability to recognize our incompetence.\n\nDunning:\n\n\"Unknown unknown solutions haunt the mediocre without their knowledge. The average detective does not realize the clues he or she neglects.  The mediocre doctor is not aware of the diagnostic possibilities or treatments never considered.  The run-of-the-mill lawyer fails to recognize the winning legal argument that is out there.  People fail to reach their potential as professionals, lovers, parents and people simply because they are not aware of the possible.  This is one of the reasons I often urge my student advisees to find out who the smart professors are, and to get themselves in front of those professors so they can see what smart looks like.\"\n\nWhen I read that, I realized why I love\n\nTED Talks\n\nso much -- it gives me easy access to seeing what smart looks like.  It also gives another angle on the role of the teacher.  People like to say 21st century learning demands teachers shift from \"the sage on the stage\" to the \"guide on the side\".  I think there are times to be the \"sage on the stage\" -- to exhibit \"unnatural acts\" of thinking (a la\n\nSam Wineburg\n\n-- more re him in a future blog post) -- though overall, I prefer the concept of the teacher as\n\n\"the meddler in the middle\"\n\n(Erica McWilliams, 2005).\n\nIn an interview Benjamin Barber\n\nreflects on the positive aspect of disturbing thoughts:\n\nLondon:\n\nIt occurs to me that you are not at all afraid of controversy — not in your statements here and not in your books certainly. You say somewhere in\n\nAn Aristocracy of Everyone\n\nthat\n\n\"with good teaching, as with good art, someone is always offended.\"\n\nIs that really true?\n\nBarber:\n\nI think so.\n\nI think that if you don't offend someone, you haven't even woken them up, let alone gotten their mental energies going.\n\nOne thing that does bother me about so-called political correctness — I don't like the term PC — it's really an unfair word, it's kind of a slur in the way that it's used. But the true part of it is that there are some people who seem unwilling to be offended and provocative speech, free speech, and most importantly educational speech — speech that makes people think — has to be to some degree offensive. That's how you get people woken up, that's how you get people caring, that's how you get them reacting.\n\nAnother vision of the teacher as a constructive mediator is the\n\ngrandmother\n\n-- in\n\nSugata Mitra\n\n's sense -- in his SOLEs (Self-Organized Learning Environments).  The person who stands behind you every now and then-- who is there to support you in your own learning.\n\nIsn't that the role of our own PLN (personal learning networks) -- for us as teacher-learners?  We just need to make sure we are allowing ourselves to be disturbed.  That is the danger for adults... that we move into spaces (mental and physical) which do not regularly perturb us.\n\n* Yes, \"unknown unknowns\" brings Donald Rumsfeld to mind -- and my favorite packaging of him is in the 2003\n\nSlate article on \"The Poetry of Donald Rumsfeld\"\n\n:\n\nThe Unknown\n\nAs we know,\n\nThere are known knowns.\n\nThere are things we know we know.\n\nWe also know\n\nThere are known unknowns.\n\nThat is to say\n\nWe know there are some things\n\nWe do not know.\n\nBut there are also unknown unknowns,\n\nThe ones we don't know\n\nWe don't know.\n\n—Feb. 12, 2002, Department of Defense news briefing",

      "title": "OUT OF THE DRAFTS FOLDER: (2009) An Injection of Ideas on Library Design",
      "content": "How many draft blog posts do you have sitting around?  Here is one from two years ago -- on library design.  I never got around to publishing it, so am doing so now - with the intent of posting a recent update of thoughts and resources, especially after hearing of a recent Kevin Hennah consultation in Kuala Lumpur with international school librarians.\n\nOn August 22nd [2009] about 30 international school librarians from around Asia gathered at ISB in Bangkok for a one-day workshop on library design by\n\nKevin Hennah\n\n, a retail merchandising consultant and designer who has done a lot of  work with libraries in Australia.\n\n(While he seems to have worked with many major companies, it was this advertising campaign in his portfolio that made the biggest visual impression on me:\n\nAustralia Post: If you really want to touch someone, send them a letter\n\n.  I should also mention his featured section in the Australian book,\n\nRethink! Ideas for Inspiring School Library Design\n\n-- and I think he said he's working on a book with\n\nOpening the Book\n\nin the UK. )\n\nThe success of the workshop can be summed up by Barb Philip's comment as she walked out: \"I feel like taking a sledgehammer to my library.\"\n\nWhat did he say? Well, others who attended the workshop have been much more efficient in sharing about it online. Within 24 hours\n\nKim Cofino, one of the event organizers, had blogged about it\n\nand\n\nTara Ethridge, the other event organizer, blogged about it\n\non Monday the 24th.\n\nAnthony Tilke posted information about it on the ECIS iSkoodle forum for librarians\n\n(registration required to view)\n\n, and\n\nBeth Gourley made public her Evernote notebook on\n\nLibrary as Space and Place\n\n, which includes her notes on Kevin's presentation.\n\nWhat can I add?  A few extension links, perhaps...\n\nKevin's value was in his slideshow presentation -- talk about visual learning! We saw over 600 images, illustrating retail principles in practice in libraries. He talked us through before-and-after shots, good examples, bad examples, interesting examples. (And, no, for copyright reasons, he said he couldn't give us copies of his presentation.)\n\nAs Kevin spoke, I kept scribbling down the names of the libraries being shown (mainly Australian and more public than school ones) -- see the\n\nlist of libraries\n\nhere. I tried to find images of them on the internet, without much success -- except for\n\nThe Idea Stores\n\nin London (UK), e.g.,\n\nsearch of Flickr for \"idea store\" and \"library\"\n\n.\n\nInstead you might have a look at some of these libraries:\n\nThe Robin Hood project\n\nin New York City, where prominent architects went in and re-vamped poor school libraries. See\n\n\"The Library Book\"\n\nhere.  See also\n\nMaira Kalman's video clip of how she created one library's alphabet display\n\n.\n\nDOK\n\nInfoToday: Discover Innovations at DOK, Holland’s 'Library Concept Center';\n\nDOK Delft's Flickr photos\n\nshowing their library's design and interior'\n\nDOK Library Concept Center -- Flickr photos from The Shifted Librarian\n\nI was familiar with the retail design approaches in libraries -- as\n\nPaco Underhill\n\n's book \"\n\nWhy We Buy: The Science of Shopping\n\n\" became popular with librarians in the US several years ago, e.g.,  see the Library Journal article\n\n\"Power Users - Designing buildings and services from the end user's viewpoint transforms access for everyone\n\n\" [2005], as well as  \"\n\nWhat libraries can learn from bookstores: Applying bookstore design to public libraries\n\n\" [2003].  But it's always good to have it re-iterated.\n\nHe recommends a \"What's Hot?\" display (see how\n\nBarb went back and immediately put that up on the wall in her library\n\n).\n\nKevin is all for ditching Dewey and using more user-friendly, bookstore-type categories to organize books. He cited the Palmerston Public Library (NT, Australia) as an example of a library choosing to organize the collection in terms of\n\n17 \"living rooms\" or categories\n\n(read this 2006 white paper \"\n\nWhere's the Dewey?\n\n\" for background on the process they went through).\n\nSimilar attempts:\n\nIt's Fine To Drop Dewey - 7/15/2009 - Library Journal\n\n-- article re another US library ditching Dewey;\n\nRangeview Library District, CO, First System To Fully Drop Dewey - 6/5/2009 - Library Journal;\n\nBehind the Maricopa County Library District’s Dewey-less Plan - 5/31/2007 - Library Journal\n\nLibrary Matters: To Dewey or not to Dewey . . .\n\n-- re a NZ library considering it;\n\nArizona Library Ditches Dewey - 7/1/2007 - School Library Journal\n\nFreeing Dewey\n\n-- a blog from a US public library in the process of dropping Dewey;\n\nLibraryThing's\n\nOpen Shelves Classification (OSC) Project\n\n-- a free, \"humble,\" modern, open-source, crowd-sourced replacement for the Dewey Decimal System;\n\nThe\n\nNational Library of Singapore\n\nhas its own variation on re-grouping Dewey, supposedly to help the public find books, but I find it confusing -- as the catalog just gives me the Dewey number - so I have to wander to find the section that Dewey number is stored in.\n\nOne thing I do like about the NLB shelves is the use of\n\nColorMarq\n\n, a library shelf ID system where each letter of the alphabet has a different color.  It makes it easy to see when a book is mis-shelved.  (I do have a problem when NLB shelvers only bother to sort by the first three letters of the authors' names.... especially in areas like BRO or WIL.)\n\n[Photos by me]",

      "content": "Two books have been guiding my thinking about research & inquiry cycles for the past couple of years.\n\na)\n\nChange by Design\n\n-- by Tim Brown, of IDEO \"design thinking\" fame.  His framework is not explicitly educational, though IDEO have published\n\na toolkit of design thinking for educators\n\n.\n\nb)\n\nGuided Inquiry Design: a framework for Inquiry in your School\n\n-- by\n\nCarol C. Kuhlthau\n\n, Leslie K. Maniotes, and Ann K. Caspari.  Kuhlthau is the grand dame of teacher-librarianship and the one who first recognized the emotional element involved in the ISP (Information Search Process) back in 1991.\n\nFor me, the most important feature they share is the recognition of that\n\nemotional element\n\nin research.  We all get discouraged - or should.  If you don't experience any dip in confidence, then it means you're not really pushing yourself in terms of researching.   Tim's sketch illustrates Carol's original insight very well.\n\nTim's design process is an incredibly simple iterative cycle between\n\nInspiration\n\n,\n\nIdeation\n\n, and\n\nImplementation\n\n(below is my sketch) -- but I think it works just as well in terms of research.\n\nCarol's latest framework is more expansive, incorporating 8 \"verb\" steps (mirroring her older ISP \"noun\" stages - shown in parentheses) :\n\nOpen\n\n(Initiation)\n\nInvitation to inquiry\n\nOpen minds\n\nStimulate curiosity\n\nImmerse\n\n(Selection)\n\nBuild background knowledge\n\nConnect to content\n\nDiscover interesting ideas\n\nExplore\n\n(Exploration)\n\nExplore interesting ideas\n\nLook around\n\nDip in\n\nIdentify\n\n(Formulation)\n\nPause and ponder\n\nIdentify inquiry questions\n\nDecide direction\n\nGather\n\n(Collection)\n\nGather important information\n\nGo broad\n\nGo deep\n\nCreate\n\n(Presentation)\n\nReflect on learning\n\nGo beyond facts to make meaning\n\nCreate to communicate\n\nShare\n\n(Presentation)\n\nLearn from each other\n\nSharing learning\n\nTell your story\n\nEvaluate\n\n(Assessment)\n\nEvaluate achievement of learning goals\n\nReflect on content\n\nReflect on process\n\nCarol's book offers plenty of practical suggestions for implementing inquiry in schools, e.g., she stresses the need for an\n\nInquiry Journal\n\n(a workspace for individual composing and reflection) as well as\n\nInquiry Charts\n\n(attempts to visualize ideas, connections, questions, etc.) and an\n\nInquiry Log\n\n(a record of sources consulted), but one of the most important points she makes is the crucial distinction between the Explore and the Gather stages.\n\nThe\n\nExplore\n\nstage is about\n\nbrowsing\n\n,\n\nscanning\n\n, and\n\nskimming\n\n.\n\n\"Dipping in\"\n\nmeans you need to relax, read, and reflect.  Sources should just be tracked in the Inquiry Log at this point.\n\nThe\n\nGather\n\nstage is about\n\ndetailed note-taking\n\n,\n\ncomprehensive searching\n\n, and\n\n\"going deep\"\n\n.  This is also the stage when you need to thinking about citing, quoting, and paraphrasing. Too often students think they have to take detailed notes on a source the first time they encounter it - before they have decided on an inquiry focus.\n\nAgain, Tim has a simple distinction which I think epitomizes the difference.\n\nHere I have added just two extra descriptions:\n\nFinding Out\n\nvs.\n\nSorting Out\n\n(a la Kath Murdoch)\n\nWhen talking to students, I now like to have them clarify which mode they think they are currently in.  And the emotional dip of uncertainty is often a sign that's time for the shift.  What a metacognitive skill -- to know how much first stage searching is enough to work with -- to have enough choices.\n\nThis is Carol's\n\nIdentify\n\nstage -- which is about focusing and establishing a meaningful inquiry question -- when the thinking shifts from divergent (broad) to convergent (deep).\n\nTim Brown insists all ideas (i.e., research questions) must be analyzed in light of three criteria:\n\nDesirability\n\n(personal interest/passion),\n\nViability\n\n(for Tim this means \"makes business sense,\" but in the educational realm it translates to \"fits the assignment or criteria\" and satisfies the big \"so what?\"), and\n\nFeasibility\n\n(the time and resources to actually complete the project).\n\nSimilarly, Carol asks students to consider their question in terms of the assigned task, their own interest, the time available, and the information and resources available.\n\nI think Tim's four basic illustrations concisely convey the key stages of research better than Carol's more elaborate theory.  I still want her book on my shelf, but, until I can get more teachers to read and absorb it, I'll be using Tim's ideas and images in conversation.",

      "content": "\"How many books are there in the library and what are the annual circulation statistics?\"\n\nsays the secondary school administrator.\n\nMy first response is,\n\nwhat do you think that measures?\n\nOkay, it's budget allocation time, so the underlying issue is financial competition with other development goals.  It's a request to justify the collection we're building as a new secondary school, finishing our second year of operation.\n\nBut let's start with the devil in the detail of\n\nour circulation statistics\n\n.\n\nBrowsing vs. Check-out:\n\nA lot of books are taken off the shelf, but don't get taken out.  They're read  in the library, then left on tables.  Every day we have to go around and pick them up.  The most popular browsing material seems to be self-help and well-being books (yes, this includes sex-ed), art and photography books, poetry, graphic format (think: cartoons, comics and manga), middle-school novels (because: teachers regularly bring their classes in for free-choice, silent sustained reading), and Chinese-language books (reasons: various).\n\nThe fact that we're open until 9:30pm four nights a week for boarding house study time increases students' browsing potential within the library -- without having to check books out.\n\nIn-library-use-only Displays:\n\nLarge numbers of curriculum-related books are kept on display tables while a grade has a particular focus - and students are asked NOT to take them out, for mass maximum access.  Students' ability to scan-to-PDF pages or chapters from books makes in-library-use-only more manageable.  Recent displays have supported units on peace and conflict resolution, human rights and up-standers/heroes, the Vietnam war, religions of the world, genetics, South Africa, etc.\n\nLibrary resources are intertwined with those of the English Dept.\n\n-- so our circulation statistics should be considered jointly.\n\nSome English teachers use the school library for their class library, checking out a box of books for in-class circulation over a long period.\n\nMultiple copies of titles bought by the English Dept. are available on library shelves for general loan -- when not needed by a particular teacher -- rather than letting them languish in departmental book cupboards.\n\nThe library buys multiple copies of recently-published titles as part of the annual\n\nRed Dot Book Awards\n\n, and those books are automatically shifted to the English Dept. (both in the catalog and on the shelves) each June.\n\nIn such a new library, large numbers of new items are constantly being added.\n\nMany resources haven't had much chance to be discovered and taken out.\n\nEach school will have its own context that weakens the power of plain circulation statistics.\n\nWhat is the ideal number of books in a secondary school library?\n\nIn different countries at different times, school library associations, whether national or regional, have cited research and quoted numbers.  12? 16? 20? 36? books per student?  I know schools that swear by each of those.\n\nBut what are we counting?  Just physical books?\n\nOur collection size and substance\n\nis definitely affected by students' access to digital resources, due to our 1:1 Macbook program for grades 6-12.\n\nTo start with, we have no need for a separate reference section -- as databases provide that so well.\n\nWhat doesn't the internet deliver as well as physical volumes in a school library?\n\nLarge-format art and design books\n\n-- ones you can spread out on a table and see many images at once.  Big beautiful books to browse.\n\nGraphic novels and sophisticated picture books.\n\nSame idea.  Big visuals.\n\nPoetry\n\n.  Yes, you can find poems on websites, but due to copyright you can't find whole collections of one poet.  And so many poetry books are physical works of art in themselves.\n\nPlayscripts.\n\nAgain, a collection not accessed every day by everyone, but a godsend to someone interested in drama.\n\nSpecial collections\n\nin one physical location, available for browsing -- Singapore books, self-help and well-being books, third-culture kids and global nomad books, \"vintage\" books (books published prior to 1950, culled from piles of donations, are a fascination to our students).  World languages (mother-tongue) collections come under this category, too.\n\nBooks the average person isn't going to buy for their home library.\n\nFor example, The Complete Illustrated and Annotated Letters of Vincent Van \nGogh.  Price: Expensive. Who is reading this, you ask?  Not just the art\n teachers.  Yes, they're assigning it -- because they're thrilled to \nhave it available.\n\nNarrative and visual non-fiction\n\n-- about science, math, history, etc.  Biographies fall in this category.\n\nExperience with non-fiction book layout standards\n\n-- e.g., how to use a table of contents, index, appendices, etc.   I find middle school teachers are particularly concerned with giving their students access to and experience with non-fiction books precisely because the internet doesn't easily allow them to absorb the conventions of research texts. I'd prefer to let databases provide (up-to-date) access to basic science, humanities, and geography information, but the teachers are still requesting a physical collection.\n\nFiction.\n\nWe're still delivering fiction via physical books for the time being.\n\nWhile ebooks are growing in popularity and availability, the software to be able to lend ebooks (e.g., Overdrive) isn't cheap or doesn't have a good enough interface yet (e.g., Destiny), plus the whole DRM (digital rights management) situation isn't easy.  Several international school libraries have bought the ebook lending software only to find the books their students want to read aren't available as ebooks (legally) outside the US or UK.\n\nOur students spend a lot of time in front of a screen and when we have tried to deliver English-class texts digitally (e.g., for works out of copyright and readily available in epub format), there has been push-back. The school's standard-issue laptop isn't the ideal ebook device.  I am also not convinced that the library should invest in mobile ereaders to lend out.\n\nDiscoverability -- seeing what's available to borrow -- is also much harder with a digital loan collection.  It's not like sweeping your eyes over a bookshelf.  (I find Overdrive very frustrating on the browsing-for-titles front.)\n\nMaking the virtual visible is one of my library mantras.\n\nNot just making the library's digital presence visually evident, but also creating a physical space that provides a sense of the world's knowledge\n\n-- organized in some fashion.  The environment is the \"third\" teacher --  therefore the library, as a physical space, should be a powerful influence upon learning.\n\nW\n\nhat I think the library space needs to do better is to connect the user with the online resources that complement and expand the physical resources on the shelf.  To let digital nuggets convince you to read a whole book; it could be a video of the author speaking or an animated illustration of a book's argument or just a great article related to the book, freely available online.\n\nI never answered the question of how many books is enough.  This comes back to the question of what we want to measure in the library - and how it can be measured.  I'll save my proposed dashboard for a separate post.\n\nImages via Flickr:\n\nBooks and Books by Kara Allyson\n\nAvian books 34 by Mal Booth\n\nThe book by giopuo",

      "content": "If you want to have a good read about the history and future of the \"making\" movement in education and tinkering as \"a mindset for learning,\" I highly recommend the book\n\n\"Invent to Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom -- by Sylvia Libow Martinez and Gary Stager\n\n.\n\nGo to their website for an overview of the chapters, with links to extended resources for each.\n\nThe best thing it did was to send me back to read/re-read\n\nSeymour Papert\n\n, the grandfather of the movement.  (I didn't realize the roots of his projects were in Maine.)\n\nI also refreshed my acquaintance with the writings of\n\nMitchel Resnick\n\n(head of the MIT Lifelong Kindergarten group) re the cycle of imagine, create, play, share, reflect, imagine.  And a biography of Nikola Tesla is on my \"to read\" list.\n\nA few notes/quotes from the book:\n\nStager's hypothesis:  \"A good prompt is worth a thousand words.\" -- where 'good' means it has (a) brevity (e.g., can fit on a post-it note), (b) ambiguity (let the learner be free to satisfy the prompt in their own voice), and (c) has immunity to assessment. (60-61)\n\nLearners can exceed expectations with the following four variables in place:\n\n-- a good prompt, motivating challenge, or thoughtful question\n\n-- appropriate materials\n\n-- sufficient time\n\n-- a supportive culture, including a range of expertise (60)\n\n\"Great teachers know that their highest calling is to make memories.\" (67)\n\n\"Constructivism is a theory of learning that doesn't mandate a specified method of teaching.... Constructionism is a theory of teaching.  We believe that constructionism is the best way to implement constructivist learning.\" (71)\n\nAdvice: skip the pre-load, don't overteach planning, encourage continuous improvement, allow reflection. (77)\n\nAssessment interrupts the learning process.  Even asking a kid what they're doing is disruptive. (81)\n\n\"Writing, filmmaking, and presenting information are the low-hanging fruit of creative expression in the digital age.\" (84)\n\n\"The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge.\" -- Seymour Papert (157)\n\nEducators need to be reminded that it is possible to learn without being taught. (202)\n\nReading the book, I remembered my father's workshop down cellar in the house in Maine where I grew up.  We loved to make things with him.  My biggest project was a bookcase that would double as my bed's headboard.  Mainly we marveled at how he could fix things.  He was definitely a tinkerer.\n\nA few years ago it was time to clear the workshop out.  After all, he'd been dead for some twenty years and no one was using it.  But I took some last photos.\n\nFull Flickr set here",

All-day interesting.  Separate blog post coming.\n\nRDA: Back to the Basics\n\n-- which explained, in illuminating detail, the benefits to libraries of the new metadata\n\nResource Description and Access\n\nstandard and how to gradually implement it via existing MARC data records.  Welcome, worthwhile. Separate blog post coming.\n\nThe conference itself involved shorter sessions.  Highlights included:\n\nCrossing the K-20 Continuum: Are Librarians Bridging Information Literacy and 21st Century Skills?\n\n--\n\na panel discussion by Kenneth Murhanna, from Kent State University, director of the\n\nTRAILS\n\nproject and author of the new book,\n\nInformed Transitions: Libraries Supporting the High School to College Transition\n\n-- see\n\nhis presentation slides (\"Battling the Unready\") here\n\n-- and Tasha Bergson-Michelson, a Google Search Educator moving in September to a girls-only high school in Palo Alto (\n\nhttp://library.castilleja.org/\n\n) -- see her presentation slides at\n\nbit.ly/SearchSources\n\n.\n\nFriction: Teaching Slow Thinking and Intentionality in Online Research\n\n-- a presentation by Debbie Abilock (NoodleTools) and Tasha Bergson-Michelson again (see above).\n\nSee presentation slides here.\n\nNot only was I thrilled to finally meet Debbie in person, having known and interacted with her online for years, but this was one of the few sessions which managed to involve the audience effectively.  If you go to\n\nhttp://bit.ly/FrictionALA\n\n, you can get links to the ten Google Docs used to record the small group discussions.\n\nI liked the idea of focusing on \"friction points\" in the research process -- where students could or should be prompted to use System Two thinking (as in Daniel Kahneman's book, \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" - one of my favorites).  More on on this in another blog post.\n\nStudying Ourselves: Libraries and the User Experience\n\n--\n\na panel presentation by a professor and two university librarians, each of whom had studied the library environment -- and students' use of the library -- using sociological and/or anthropological research methods.  The sociology professor, Andrew Abbott, was particularly fascinating.  Again, more in another blog post.\n\nLibrarARy Orientation: Augmented Reality in the Library:  Reality\n\n-- a quick session by the University of Houston librarians on how they are using Aurasma, a free augmented reality app, to enhance their library orientation sessions.\n\nClick here\n\nfor their Prezi presentation.  I had already played with Aurasma and found it interesting to see how they were using it.  More on this later.\n\nBleak New World: YA Authors Decode Dystopia\n\n-- a panel discussion by four top-notch dystopia authors, from old to young:\n\nLois Lowry\n\n(\"The Giver\"),\n\nCory Doctorow\n\n(\"Little Brother\"),\n\nPatrick Ness\n\n(\"The Knife of Never Letting Go\"), and\n\nVeronica Roth\n\n(\"Insurgent\").  As Ness said, the best YA books promote the question, \"what would you do if....?\" And another of them said, dystopia is not a story, but a way to tell a story.\n\nJaron Lanier: Who Owns the Future?\n\n-- An auditorium presentation by a major player in the making of today's digital world, unafraid to criticize it with compelling economic arguments in\n\nhis new book\n\n.  Also thoroughly charming. I'm a long-time follower of his thinking, so I felt like it was a fireside chat with an old friend, bringing up scary topics (too true, big data is a big danger), but also reassuring that we can change history by raising awareness at critical moments. (What a lovable hippie....).  Google him for all kinds of resources, starting with\n\nhis homepage\n\n.\n\nPing Fu: Bend Not Break\n\n-- An auditorium \npresentation by a woman who grew up in the worst of China's Cultural Revolution and today is a cutting edge American entrepreneur in the 3D digital \"maker\" space, thanks to her company,\n\nGeomagic\n\n.  Her story is fascinating - as she started out doing comparative literature in China, while computer science was her ticket to success in the States.  In the photo below, note her her shoes and scarf are both 3D-printed objects.\n\nFor more info re her book, see her website:\n\nbendnotbreak.com\n\n-- though she has come under a lot of scrutiny for some of her depictions of the Cultural Revolution.  Has she exaggerated or mis-remembered?  Google it yourself, if you're interested in the controversy.  I still enjoyed listening to a rags-to-riches-via-technology American immigrant woman on stage -- and hope some of my students will read her autobiography.\n\nBeyond Genre: Exploring the Perception, Uses, and Misuses of Genres by Readers, Writers, etc.\n\n-- a panel discussion by three popular writers (for adults, not teens or children) -- crime novelist\n\nLaura Lippman\n\n(wife of David Simon, if that name means anything to you fans of \"The Wire\"),\n\nMargaret Dilloway\n\n, and\n\nNaomi Novik\n\n, fantasy writer and analyst of fandom fiction.  All new-to-me authors.  The comments that stuck with me include:   \"Never forget, literature can be done within genre; the author is potentially limited, not the form.\"  Also a reminder of the benefit of genre lists, i.e., booklists that help young people in a library looking for the next thing to read.  NB:  Since the session the organizers have posted a long list of resources related to genres -- it's well worth a look:\n\nBeyond Genre: Research and Trends PDF\n\n.\n\nNext year ALA is in Las Vegas, a place I would normally not go near.  Now it sounds quite attractive.\n\n*ALA - the American Library Association's annual conference, held at the end of June (convenient for those of us on the northern hemisphere school calendar - and for me regularly winging my way from Singapore to Maine - so any US city is \"on the way\".... this year it was Chicago...).  A conference that attracts 26,000 librarians/attendees.  Yes, think mega-library.  Below is a photo which gives an idea of the expanse of the exhibition space -- which I navigated, iPhone in hand, snapping books and ideas to pursue later.\n\nAll photos taken by me.",

      "content": "The\n\nRed Dot book awards\n\n(\n\nreddotawards.com\n\n) are one of those hybrid awards:  students vote on shortlists selected by adults (school librarians).  Eight books in four categories, one winner in each -- followed by a Readers Cup competition between international schools here in Singapore.\n\n\"But what's the mission statement?  Good literature or just promoting books from various countries?\"\n\nsomeone asked as we gathered to sort through the longlists of the four categories this year.\n\nMy gut response was \"good literature from various countries.\"\n\nThe\n\nawards website's \"About\" page\n\nsays:\n\nThe Red Dot categories are roughly based on readers,\n rather than book formats or school divisions.  (NB: It is up to every \nlibrarian to determine which books are right for which classes in your \nschool to read.)\n\nEarly Years\n\n(ages 3-7)\n\n--\n\nformerly\n\nPicture Books\n\nYounger Readers\n\n(ages 7-10)\n\n--\n\nformerly\n\nJunior\n\n) --\n\n(where\n\nCaptain Underpants\n\nand\n\nGeronimo Stilton\n\nare the assumed reading level)\n\nOlder Readers\n\n(ages 10-14)\n\n--\n\nformerly\n\nMiddle\n\n) -- (where\n\nInkheart\n\nand\n\nThe Lightning Thief\n\nare the assumed reading level)\n\nMature Readers\n\n(ages 14-adult)\n\n--\n\n(formerly\n\nSenior\n\n) --  (where\n\nTwilight\n\nand\n\nThe Book Thief\n\nare the assumed reading level)\n\nShortlist titles are chosen by a committee of teacher-librarians from\n\nrecent\n children's literature (first published in English within the past four \nyears), with the goal of offering a range of books from around the world\n\n.\n\nThe initiative is now entering its fifth year, just long enough for its origins to deserve review -- especially given our transient teaching population.\n\n2009 - 2010 website\n\n2010 - 2011 website\n\n2011 - 2012 website\n\n2012 - 2013 website\n\n2013 - 2014 - website under development\n\nAs one of its creators, it was interesting for me to go back through the minutes of meetings and  posts in the Google Group of our local network -\n\nISLN\n\n(International Schools Library Network - Singapore) and remember how it developed.\n\nFirst there was Barb Philip Reid, a NZ/Australian teacher-librarian at Tanglin Trust School, back in September 2008 wanting to get a Readers Cup going between all our schools, similar to the\n\nReaders Cup in Australia\n\n.   As research, she and I did a librarians-on-tour trip to Hong Kong in May 2009 to watch the finale of the\n\nannual Battle of the Books\n\n(based on a well-established American model) run by their international school library network,\n\nALESS\n\n.\n\nAt the same time I had been wanting to get an annual international students-voting book award going in Singapore, inspired by the\n\nPanda Book Awards\n\ncreated by SLIC (School Librarians in China) and the\n\nSakura Medal\n\nstarted by the international school librarians in Japan.  (The French international schools in Asia run a similar program: see\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n\n-- and there is now the\n\nMorning Calm Medal\n\nin South Korea.)\n\nBarb and I figured, why not combine the two ambitions and start an annual book \naward program, whose shortlists would become the source of the Readers Cup \ncompetition booklists.  Introduce the books in Oct/Nov, vote in March, \nand the three older categories (as shown) would compete in May.\n\nYounger Readers - Year 3, 4 & 5 / Grade 2, 3 & 4\n\nOlder Readers - Year 5, 6, 7, & 8 / Grade 4, 5, 6 & 7\n\nMature Readers - Year 8+ / Grade 7+\n\nOur booklists would then necessarily be \"formative\" ones, meaning only fairly recent literature, in contrast to the \"summative\" kind most \"Battle of the Books\" (Google it) use, mixing old and new titles.  Both have their place.  The \"summative\" approach guarantees kids don't miss great books from any era.  The \"formative\" ensures students and teachers are exposed to the best of the latest -- and encourages schools to buy multiple copies of new titles every year, potentially freshening up the book cupboards.\n\nWe got a committee together and in October 2009 it was announced the award would be called the \"Red Dots\" (as\n\nSingapore is proud of that epithet\n\n).   The shortlists followed in November, with 14 schools immediately signing up to participate, including a British school, an American \nschool, a German school, a French school, a Canadian school, an \nAustralian school, plus just plain Anglo-heritage/international ones.  And so it started, and has continued, with some variation in implementation.\n\nEach school can do what they want with the lists.  Buy them all or only a selection.  Participate in voting or not.  Participate in the Readers Cup or not.  Give your students different criteria for choosing one book to vote for in each category.  (Your personal favorite? The one you would recommend to friends the most?)  We only say students should probably have read at least two books in a category in order to make a choice.  We do expect just one vote per student per category.  Results are tallied by category and school, and then for all the schools, giving us overall winners.\n\nAn International Approach (in Singapore)\n\nBut back to the question, how do we choose titles?   What assumptions has the committee been working on over the past five years?\n\nBarb and I did a presentation at the 2010 IASL (International Association of School Librarians) in Brisbane, Australia, on \"Creating Internationally Literate Readers\" (see\n\nthe workshop website\n\nand\n\nour conference paper\n\n), which recounted the Red Dot story and summarized the challenges we face in choosing books suitable for and accessible to the wide range of students in our various international schools.\n\nWe brought up the danger of the single story (a la Chimamanda Adichie's TED talk) and the need for books to serve as both mirrors and windows of culture for children, especially given the predominance of \"third culture\" kids in our schools.  We showed examples of books that bridge cultures well - and others that are problematic.  For example, the question always has to be asked, is this book too American? too British? too Australian? too Canadian? too Singaporean? etc.\n\nThere are so many factors, but these are the major ones considered for the Red Dot books:\n\nPublication date\n\n:  published in English within the past four years.  That seems to increase the chance that books are available in paperback.  It also allows enough time for us to take advantage of other/national book awards which may be limited to just the past year - we can choose from their backlists.\n\nCost and ease of access\n\n:  If a book is perfect, but not available through our regular book-buying channels, or only available in hardcover, we hesitate to choose it.  Likewise, if a book is available as an ebook as well as print, that would give it extra points.  Everyone runs their Red Dot program differently, but we assume multiple copies will be purchased.\n\nGenres\n\n:  with only eight titles per category, variety is desirable, but there is no formula.  One non-fiction? One poetry or verse novel? One graphic novel? One fantasy? One historical fiction?   One book in translation?  One book featuring global concerns, like child labor or refugees or war? There has been talk of starting a separate category for graphic novels.  Maybe next year?\n\nReading Level vs. Reader Maturity Level\n\n:  This is the hardest thing to gauge.  Where to place a book.  Sometimes we get it wrong.  There is an assumed one year overlap (at least for the Readers Cup) \nbetween Younger and Older Readers, and Older and Mature Readers.  And schools have different comfort levels with language and content.  All we can say is, each librarian is responsible for reading and placing the books in their school.  There is no requirement that each school stock each book.  Students don't have to read all the books in order to vote.\n\nCountry of origin or country of flavor\n\n:  We like to include a book or two in each category that reflects the region.  Having said that, we try not to privilege country of origin over quality.   If there's a good one from Singapore, that's great (especially if the author likes to do school visits), but if not, we would be happy with a good one from, or set in, another Asian country.  Also, no one country of origin should dominate a list.  When in doubt, think international.\n\nLiterary vs. Popular\n\n:  This is the tension in the modified children's choice style of book awards.  They don't pick the longlist or shortlist - they only get to vote.  So are we choosing books we want them to read?  Or books they would choose to read on their own?  Should we choose a book if we already have a sense that it's going to a big hit?  Or avoid the easy choice and try to put another one in their path, a lesser known one that could have just as much appeal?  (Some of our past choices might look like we went for a bestseller, but if you check the dates, we chose them before their massive popularity - e.g., \"The Hunger Games\".)\n\nThe bottom line is, we are buying multiple copies of these books.  They might not have to be texts worth teaching in depth, but if the extra copies are going to be used (after the Red Dot cycle is over) for literature circles or to enhance class libraries, then we want both quality and appeal.  I know I want books my students can possibly make at least two connections with (using the\n\nKeene & Zimmerman / Harvey & Goudvis strategies\n\n):\n\nText-to-Self\n\n-- emotional or personal connections -- think empathy...\n\nText-to-World\n\n-- social or political or historical connections -- relevant issues or introduction to other cultures...\n\nText-to-Text\n\n-- literary/literacy or intellectual connections -- perhaps an author, series, or genre that will keep kids reading...\n\nBalance is Everything\n\nThis means within the list, across the categories, and across the years.  For all the factors above.\n\nI found some old photos of our Red Dot committee shortlist meeting from September 2010.   Here we are:  drinks, nibbles, laptops (note the person being skyped in), smartphones, and books.  I recall it was a marathon session.\n\nAnd here's the whiteboard where the balance of the lists was incessantly being assessed.\n\nThis year we've split into two groups to do the selection:  Early/Younger and Older/Mature.  Time is ticking and we should be finishing our lists within the next two weeks.  There are books to be bought.  And a new website to get up and running.  Watch\n\nreddotawards.com\n\nfor updates......",

      "content": "The last time our school posted a library job, it asked for a\n\nTeacher-Librarian\n\n(TL).*\n\nThis time it says\n\nwe need a\n\nLibrary Facilitator\n\n.  (Apply by October 23!)  Primary or secondary.  (While I'm in secondary now, I'm flexible.)\n\nWhere did the teaching go?  It's still in there, but shifted - from direct to indirect - while retaining learning as the priority.  Read the job responsibilities:\n\nWork collaboratively with library staff across the campus and college.\n\nWork collaboratively with the curriculum leaders and department heads to develop resources and promote inquiry-based learning and all forms of literacy.\n\nWork collaboratively with all members of the community (whether students, parents, or staff) to support teaching and learning.\n\nManage the library as a learning environment and public space, including patron services and library staff.\n\nManage and develop learning resources, physical and digital, both for the library and classrooms/departments.\n\nLead the development and promotion of the library as a centre dedicated to the spread of ideas, information, and learning.\n\nOther responsibilities as determined by the Head of Libraries and Head of Campus.\n\nThe issue is our librarian-student ratio.\n\nWith only two teacher-librarians, one in the primary library and one in the secondary library, and 2,600 students total, the ratio is challenging (to be euphemistic).  We  have roughly 1,000 students in primary and 1,300 students this year in middle/high school (secondary) - and will be adding another 300 students in secondary next year, for a maximum of 2,600 on this new campus.  (And we have a mirror campus across town with 2,900 students, K-12.)\n\nHow can one person \"teach\" 1,000 students?\n\nThey can't.  At least not regularly.  Instead they must focus on developing teachers' capacity (as a coach, modeling lessons and acting as a consultant) and learning resources (from pathfinders via Libguides to videos, podcasts, slide presentations), not to mention running a facility that is a learning space by default (the environment as the 3rd teacher), hosting events and initiatives.   Our libraries are in prominent well-trodden paths.  There's no danger of students not coming into them.  Two major pillars of support are the stalwart library staff and the motivated and multi-talented parent body.  Both are critical to maintaining library sanity.\n\nDid I mention that, at this campus, the library is also responsible for the processing and management of all teaching resources?  This includes textbooks for secondary (where we have them) and reading/writing workshop resources for middle and primary (i.e., literature circles and class libraries).  In addition, the secondary library works closely with departments to ensure multiple copies of great books for each age and subject are available (imagine \"Hot Reads for High School\" across disciplines).\n\nIn this situation, we decided that the librarian half is more important than the teacher half in recruiting a new person.  Hence the word \"facilitator\" over \"teacher\".  We played with several others.  Coach? Curriculum Liaison? Curriculum Developer?  Curriculum Leader?\n\nWe have great teachers.  And we have a great number of resources, digital and physical.  What we need is someone dedicated to connecting the two efficiently.  Perhaps we are just looking for a TL committed to the Flipped Classroom -- who is also excited by metadata.  Because that's what the librarian end should be focusing on -- ensuring easy, intellectual access to everything (the curriculum++) from anywhere.  And this must be accomplished while living in the center of the library, where the students live each day.   It's a front-of-office job with back-of-office responsibilities.\n\nSo consider applying.  Whether you agree with our label or not.  \nWhat's important is that you appreciate our situation and feel you could\n not only cope, but add value.\n\nHead of Library role is another interesting definition to consider.  This is how I describe it at the moment.\n\nDevelop staffing plans and co-ordinate staff recruitment and deployment\n\nCo-ordinate the budget process\n\nRepresent the library team in a variety of settings\n\nFacilitate communication between libraries across the campus and college\n\nDevelop a strategic plan and co-ordinate goal-setting for the libraries\n\nCo-ordinate staff professional development\n\nManage facility planning and development\n\nDevelop library policies and procedures\n\nLiaise with heads of departments &\n\ngrades about policy and procedures relating to the management of learning resources (e.g., textbooks and class libraries)\n\nOversee the provision of information services\n\nComments welcome.... as well as sympathy.\n\nUpdate Oct 15:\n\nI forgot to mention two other very very very important positions that complement the library ones.\n\nThe primary school has two\n\ndigital literacy coaches\n\nas well as one\n\nliteracy coach\n\n(in charge of the reading/writing workshop learning).  There are also two digital literacy coaches in secondary.\n\nSo five other people in the school are supporting other literacies (digital, traditional, etc.) that in a smaller school would probably fall within the teacher-librarian's remit.  Which helps a lot.\n\nI always draw the relationship like this:\n\nAlso note the head of library responsibilities listed above are additional to a basic role.  I have to do that as Head of Library on top of being the secondary school teacher-librarian (or library facilitator).\n\nUpdate Oct 17:\n\nSeveral questions keep coming up.\n\n1)  Is this a teaching position, with a teacher's contract and benefits?  Yes.\n\n2)  Is there library support staff?  Yes.  Lovely, hard-working staff.  And we have just been given approval to advertise for a local-hire, administrative librarian for our campus (the other campus already has one - giving them three fully-qualified librarians, including the TLs).\n\n3)  What about the\n\nonline portfolio\n\nthat must be submitted?\n\nIn addition to the usual requirement for applicants to submit a resume and letter of application, candidates for this position should also submit an online portfolio showing evidence of implementation/innovation in these six overlapping areas of the library:\n\npatrons\n\n;\n\nresources\n\n;\n\nteaching & learning\n\n;\n\nevents & initiatives\n\n;\n\nthe library environment\n\nas \"the 3rd teacher\"; l\n\nibrary staff/team\n\n.\n\nOur campus is moving towards teacher portfolios instead of appraisals, so this seemed a good way to have new staff start off -- by showing us things you've done that you're proud of and that have made a difference to the learning in the institutions you've worked in.  Feel free to interpret the six areas as you will and to fashion a portfolio that suits you.  Just give us something to click.\n\n* For the record, I have always been irritated by the American term, \"Library Media Specialist\".  Years before I became one, I imagined such a person in charge of just CDs and DVDs (ok, it was many years ago).....",

      "title": "Liberate your book cupboards and create a more true \"bookstore\" model in your school library?",
      "content": "We all enjoy the mental exercise of comparing libraries and bookstores as spaces where humans come to interact with books.\n\nLibraries nobly address users' needs (the story goes), while bookstores focus on their wants -- and therefore provide a better browsing experience, being organized for optimum attention rather than intellectual access.\n\nPositing bookstores as the outside competition prompts us to examine and improve discoverability in our library environment -- to increase the likelihood people will find the books they want - or, more importantly, books they didn't even know they wanted.\n\nFirst there's the basic environmental psychology of shopping, which\n\nPaco Underhill\n\nexplained so well in his 1999 book,\n\nWhy We Buy: the science of shopping\n\n-- what I think of as the \"grocery store\" approach. Put the most frequently purchased items at the back of the store, forcing people to walk through the space and be exposed to more merchandise.  Put the tempting last-minute purchases (the candy and gossip magazines) in the checkout aisle.  Make as much stuff face-front display as possible (who buys cereal by looking at the spine of the box?).\n\nMore commonly, talk of implementing bookstore models in libraries is associated with ditching Dewey (e.g.,\n\nsee this September 2012 article\n\nin\n\nSchool Library Journal\n\n) in favor of sections with real names on prominent signs (\"Science Fiction\", \"Sports\", \"Travel\", etc.), not decimal numbers.  Of course, we all ditch Dewey to some degree.  Everyone has an A-Z author-sorted \"Fiction\" section outside the 800s.  Many have a separate \"Biography\" section.  Every collection outside the run of the Dewey numbers can be claimed as a victory by the bookstore model.\n\nThe Magic of Multiple Copies\n\nBut there's one aspect of the bookstore model that most libraries don't or can't reproduce -- having multiple copies on the shelf and potentially more stock \"out back\" somewhere.\n\nIn our library this year, we have started to create \"bookstore\" sections.  Book covers facing out.  Rough grouping by author or genre.  Multiple copies behind the front book. And, most importantly, a paper place-holder sign showing you what book is normally shelved in the spot -- and a QR code to let you see how many copies are still available.\n\nWe started with the English Dept'.s resources, creating a\n\nHot Reads for High School\n\n(\n\nover 250 titles so far\n\n) and a\n\nMiddle School Reading Zone\n\n(\n\nover 170 titles so far\n\n).  Next the Math Dept. came up with a list of books to buy multiple copies, and the Economics Dept. wasn't far behind.  We've put those titles face-front at the beginning of the subject Dewey section in Nonfiction.\n\nThe best thing is - you can booktalk efficiently.  The selection is smaller and definitely selected - by virtue of the curriculum or a teacher or librarian. And there is an instant supply!\n\nBecause that's the usual frustration of a school librarian in front of a group of students - booktalking when only one copy is available.  What if you could booktalk a book and have 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 144+ copies available?\n\nThe project started with our middle school's foray into Reading \nWorkshop, with its focus on literature circles instead of whole-grade \nnovel study, and our Grade 9 English teachers deciding they wanted to \nkick off the year with a wide reading initiative (inspired by Penny \nKittle's\n\nBook Love\n\n) before having to hone in on IGCSE texts.\n\nHow could we quickly produce varied \nclass libraries for 8+ English classrooms per grade level?  Where would these books come from?\n\nSolution: \n Take all the multiple copies previously purchased for whole-class novel study by the English Dept. and make them available to all \nstudents (when not required by a particular teacher).  Then choose some extra titles for purchase, whether in small or large sets, based on curriculum need or teacher/librarian choice.  Finally, for us, add in the multiple \ncopies purchased as part of running of the annual Red Dot\n Awards (\n\nsee history here\n\n).\n\nVoila!  The library as massive class library.  With multiple copies of great books available on the shelf.  This is our \"Best Books for Middle School\" list, our \"This is What Your Child Will Be Reading in English Class\" list, our \"What Your Teacher Recommends\" list.  Parents love it, as do kids.  It's the quick pick-up zone.  The whole Fiction section still has a fantastic selection of books, but students don't have to negotiate it until they are motivated to do so.\n\nI want to focus now on the logistics of our implementation.  Because \nthere always are tricks that make things work, in any given situation.\n\nQ:  How to you keep multiple copies on the shelf?\n\nA:   Our shelves are deep enough to store a stack of books behind a simple \nmetal bookend, bent to hold a front-facing book on display.  The excess \nare kept in a backroom, handy enough that library staff can go retrieve \nthem to replenish the shelf stock or upon request.\n\nQ:  What if all the \"hot reads\" are gone?  How do I know what is all out?\n\nA:  There is still evidence left behind.  No titles out of sight, out of mind. We have made A5 (half of 8.5x11\" sheets, for you Americans) printouts showing the cover plus a QR code and shortened URL -- which take you to the catalog, showing how many copies are still available.\n\nQR codes are magic.  I've liked them from the beginning and have them sprinkled around my library, connecting the visible with the virtual.\n\nI recommend you get\n\nShortenMe\n\nin the Chrome Extension store.  With one click, you get an instant QR code and goo.gl \nURL.\n\nNB: if \nyou're using Follett Destiny, you always need to add your site number at\n the end of the URL before shortening it (e.g., blahblahblah\n\n&site=100\n\n).  Contact me if you use Destiny and don't know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe A5 paper signs go into re-usable stiff plastic \"card cases\". Sample at left.\n\nQ:  How do people know if there are more copies out back?\n\nA:  By scanning the QR code or typing in the Goo.gl shortened URL provided on every display stand -- both of which link into our catalog, e.g.,\n\nclick here\n\nto see availability of\n\nThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas\n\n.\n\nAs mentioned above, this model is being extended into subject \ndepartments in high school, creating pockets of the \"bookstore \nexperience\" within the Dewey run.\n\nMathematics\n\n,\n\nEconomics\n\n, History, and \nDrama are the first.\n\nTo the right are books on the Mathematics shelves in the Dewey section.\n\nWe have virtual walls, too, mirroring these bookstore sections -- thanks to a new HP large-format printer, which can make posters up to 1.x meters in size.  See examples in the slideshow below.",

      "content": "If I could wave a magic wand and improve Follett Destiny as a school library catalog, it would be to improve ways of linking and looking into it.\n\nHere are a few ways to ameliorate the situation.\n\n1)  Share a Destiny link -- the need to add the all-important 'site' information\n\nHave you ever wanted to send a Destiny link to a title, resource list, or copy category to someone?  If so, you know you HAVE TO add:\n\n&site=NUMBER\n\nto the end of the link, where NUMBER is usually 100, 101, 102, 103, etc.\n\nWe host our own catalog, so that's all we have to do.  I just learned that if Follett hosts your catalog, you also have to add:\n\n&context=BLAH\n\nFor example:  &context=saas18_8553630&site=100\n\nYou can see your particular site information by hovering over the link that gets you into your particular catalog.  For example, our Dover Secondary library is site 100, our Dover Primary library is site 101, our East Primary library is 102, and our East Secondary library is 103.  So that information is added to any link we send to anyone.\n\nUpdate 12Apr14:\n\nIf Follett hosts your catalog and you need to find your CONTEXT number, look at the URL when you see all your catalogs displayed -- and it will be at the end of the URL:\n\n2)  Get a Destiny link -- to a set of search results\n\nIf you want to send someone a \"canned\" (\"tinned\"?) search -- such that they can dynamically search the catalog by clicking on a link, you need to edit the URL.\n\nFor example, suppose I want to send someone a link that will do a keyword search on \"economics\".  I put \"economics\" in the Basic Search box and press Enter.  The URL that results is not reproducible -- you can't send it to someone and get the same results.  Instead you need to choose \"Refine your search\" and work with that URL.\n\nWhen you get that URL, you need to change the word \"present\" to \"handle\":\n\nLastly, I have to add the site/context info, e.g., here is the final URL.\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/\n\nhandle\n\nbasicsearchform.do?keywordText=\n\neconomics\n\n&siteTypeID=-2&searchType=keyword&siteID=&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&mediaSiteID=&doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nThe URL above\n\nwill do a keyword search on \"economics\" for the East Second Library of UWCSEA and present the results.\n\nNote:  You can also use DQL (Destiny Query Language) to do a more complicated search out of the Basic search box (because you can't access meaningful URLs based on an Advanced Search).\n\nSee the Destiny Help system for more information, e.g.,\n\n3)  Goodreads -- how to click to check if you already have a Goodreads book in your Destiny catalog\n\nFirst, find a book in Goodreads.  On the Title information page, look for \"online stores\" and \"book links\" at the bottom.  It's the \"Book Links\" bit that you (and your patrons) can customize to go to your school's Destiny catalog to check availability.\n\nAngie Erickson and I presented a workshop on\n\n\"Geeking out with Goodreads\"\n\nin September at the Google Apps Summit here in Singapore -- and put \"how to\" information about integration with Follett Destiny up on a Google Site page here:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/geekingoutwithgoodreads/library-catalog-interfaces\n\n4)  Book Cover Displays -- mirroring bits of your collection via Goodreads or LibraryThing or showing \"Latest Arrivals\" via Pinterest\n\nMany people use Goodreads or LibraryThing to generate book display widgets for parts of their catalog.\n\nBasically, you reproduce a Resource List or Copy Category (i.e., a list of books) in your catalog into Goodreads or LibraryThing or Pinterest -- and then put them on a shelf or board or tag them.\n\nE.g., here is the 2013-2014 Red Dot books for Older Readers -- display out of Goodreads:\n\nISLN\\ \\(Int'l\\ School\\ Library\\ Network\\)'s bookshelf: 2013-2014-short-list-older\n\nISLN (Int'l School Library Network) Singapore's favorite books »\n\nShare\n\nbook reviews\n\nand ratings with ISLN (Int'l School Library Network), and even join a\n\nbook club\n\non Goodreads.\n\nUpdate 12Apr14:\n\nIf you \"pin\" books from within your Destiny catalog (adding the &site=xxx as per above), then when users click through on the board, they will be taken to the title in your catalog.\n\nPinterest, unlike Goodreads and LibraryThing, is a time-sensitive -- last in, first out -- list.  So it's perfect for showing things like \"Latest Arrivals\". (In Destiny Quest, users can see latest arrivals, but only 10 or so and you can't control what is on that list.   Via Pinterest, you can choose the books to advertise.\n\nAnd here are some links to Pinterest boards that show our latest arrivals:\n\nNew -- History books -- East\n\nNew -- Science books -- East\n\nNew -- Economic books -- East\n\n5)  LibraryThing for Libraries -- Book Display Widgets -- linking back to Destiny\n\nLibraryThing for Libraries\n\nhas a javascript\n\nBook Widget generator available via Bowker\n\nfor about US$ 400 -- which allows you to create any number of book display widgets in four different styles that will let people click on a book cover and go directly to that item in your school catalog.\n\nWe're now using it to get beautiful displays of booklists on our Libguide pages, e.g., see our\n\nEconomics: Introduction: Books & Physical Resources\n\nand our\n\nMathematics: Introduction: Books & Physical Resources\n\nguides.\n\nThe widget can take a variety of inputs -- as the screenshot to the right shows.\n\nIf you want to have the book covers displayed link back to your own catalog -- you need to use the \"LibraryThing.com User\".  When you buy the widget generator, you automatically get a LibraryThing account to put books into.  The widget works off LibraryThing \"Collections\" -- so when you enter or import titles, put them in a Collection.\n\nIf you have a Destiny Resource List and want those titles imported into LibraryThing, you can run a \"Title/Copy List\" report out of Destiny -- which includes the ISBN of copies. When the report is displayed, select all and copy the whole text output.  Then in LibraryThing go to \"Add Books\" then \"Import Books\" -- and paste that text into the \"Grab ISBN\" box.  Identify what collection you want them imported into -- then import.\n\nYou can then create a widget based on that collection.\n\nYou can also dump your whole school catalog as MARC records out of Destiny - and LibraryThing will upload them in batch mode -- though you can't identify tags or collections upon import.\n\nIn order to have the widget link back to your catalog, you have to tell LibraryThing how to search your catalog using a URL, e.g.,\n\nISBN search:\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/handlenumbersearchform.do?\n\nsearchOption=3\n\n&searchText=\n\nMAGICNUMBER\n\n&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&siteTypeID=-2&siteID=&mediaSiteID=&doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nTitle search:\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/handlebasicsearchform.do?keywordText=\n\nKEYWORDS\n\n&siteTypeID=101&searchType=title&siteID=&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&mediaSiteID=&doNotSaveSearchHistory=false&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nAccess-based URL:\n\nhttp://catalog.uwcsea.edu.sg\n\n/cataloging/servlet/presenttitledetailform.do?siteTypeID=101&siteID=&includeLibrary=true&includeMedia=false&mediaSiteID=&bibID=\n\nACCESSION\n\n&awardGroupID=-1\n\n&site=103\n\nAfter you get these Global Configurations set up, creating the widget is straight-forward.\n\nHere are the four styles available:\n\n3D Carousel example:\n\nDynamic Grid example:\n\nCarousel example:\n\nScrolling example:\n\nNB:  As it's javascript, it's not possible to embed these widgets into Google Sites nor in the Destiny HTML homepage.\n\n6)  Destiny Homepage -- call numbers and collections....\n\nLast but not least, I think we all should be providing better clues about the structure of our catalogs on our Destiny homepages.\n\nWhen I get to somebody's catalog start page, I have no way of knowing how many books they have or how they've organized their collections.  So I'll look at Resource Lists and Visual Search lists, but if people haven't create any -- then it's a blind search box and I have to guess.\n\nIdeally I'd like to create a map showing my library's layout and physical collections as well as digital resources -- and have that on my homepage.\n\nUntil I get around to to doing that, I list all the major call number prefixes on\n\nour Destiny Home Page\n\n.",

      "title": "Connecting books and readers via the virtual, visible, spatial, and personal",
      "content": "I have a penchant for schematics.  Below is the one I made while thinking about the types of connections between readers and books -- and ways to enable them.\n\nNote: when choosing ways to connect, three factors must always be considered:  Can it\n\nscale\n\n? (i.e., will it work for large numbers)  Is it easily\n\naccessible\n\n?  How will it be\n\nmaintained\n\n?\n\nWe recently started an initiative that manages to combine all four delivery methods.\n\nThe personal\n\nconnection is that we invite secondary school teachers to identify the books they want to recommend to their students.  The library then buys 3+ copies of those books for the general library collection.\n\nThe virtual\n\nconnection is a booklist of the titles via our library catalog, e.g., see\n\nDr. Alex's Favorites\n\n(where Alex McGregor is the head of History).\n\nThe visual\n\nconnection is a huge skeuomorphic bookshelf poster (thanks to a new big Epson printer and\n\nthis *.jpg of a blank wooden bookshelf\n\n) of the booklist, with a QR code linking to the list.\n\nTo give you an idea of the size, the blank spots on the \"shelf\" are A4 \nsize (8.5\"x11\") so teachers can add books to their shelf (read: maintenance) -- by printing \nout a cover and just blue-tacking it into place.  (Who said cutting and pasting is dead?)  See below example of a poster on a classroom wall.\n\nThe spatial\n\nconnection is a display shelf in the library where multiple copies of each book are displayed - in a very visible way.  (The wall posters are also displayed, but as A4 size in acrylic holders.)\n\nThe books are placed face-out with the extra copies stacked behind -- and in the event that all copies are gone, we have a mini-poster (another visual connection) which is a piece of paper inside a plastic sleeve -- which has a QR code and shortened URL leading to the title in the library catalog, so people can check how many copies are available.  I always complain you can't see what books are missing when looking at a shelf -- this way you can permanently display the most important or popular titles.\n\nWill we have room for all the teachers' selections?  We'll find the space....\n\nClick here\n\nfor a Google Presentation showing all the book wall posters made so far.\n\nNext I want to some teachers to write up little booktalking blurbs and see if we can hang them off the metal holders -- the way independent bookstores do.....",

      "title": "International School Librarians' Knowledge Sharing Weekend in Brunei: my take-aways",
      "content": "A huge thank-you to Karli Downey and her team at Jerudong International School in Brunei for hosting a valuable two-day workshop for international school librarians, Feb. 21-22, 2014.  About thirty of us came together from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and Brunei to share our practice and thoughts.\n\nSee the\n\nLKSW Libguide\n\nfor an overview.\n\nThe highlights for me included:\n\nLyn Hay\n\n, from\n\nSybaAcademy\n\nand Charles Sturt University, spoke on the concept of the iCentre (\n\nsee her slides here\n\n)\n\nRead on: Mal Lee blog:\n\nhttp://schoolevolutionarystages.net/\n\nand \"digital normalization\"\n\nLyn Hay also spoke about\n\nguided inquiry\n\n-- and\n\nLinda Twitchett (AISS) spoke\n\nabout how she developed a scope and sequence of information fluency for her secondary school.\n\nAs Lyn listed the\n\nseven survival skills a la Tony Wagner\n\n, I mentally tried to remember the 9 elements of our\n\nUWCSEA profile\n\n:  Qualities ( Commitment to Care, Principled, Resilient, Self-Aware) and Skills (Critical Thinker, Creative, Collaborative, Communicator, Self-Manager).  Information fluency/literacy is implicit in the descriptions of each.\n\nMade me realize our library team needs to schedule time with our curriculum dept to continue to hash out our own research model.  Linda came up with four main stages:\n\nExploring\n\n,\n\nInvestigating\n\n,\n\nProcessing\n\n, and\n\nCreating\n\n.  Our middle school has most recently settled on five stages:\n\nIdentify and ask relevant questions\n\nGather and organise information from different perspectives\n\nAnalyse, synthesise and evaluate information\n\nCommunicate\n\nReflection\n\nMade me re-read my blog post on \"\n\nCarol Kuhlthau meets Tim Brown: Guided {Design} Inquiry\n\n\"\n\nLyn highly recommended Keri Smith's book,\n\nHow to be an explorer of the world\n\n-- which is one of those books I hesitate to buy for the library, as it's meant to be written in and personalised.\n\nCheck out\n\nLinda's Libguide on Research\n\n.\n\nCrys Mills reminded us of some great Australian picture books -- I put\n\nthe list here in LibraryThing\n\n-- and will double-check we have them.\n\nLibrary tech topics....\n\nIn the RFID discussion Rob George reminded us that RFID isn't sufficient for security, that most libraries still use magnetic strips for that.  We don't anticipate going to RFID though the self-check and ease of inventory are appealing.\n\nThumbprint (biometric) recognition for check-out with Follett Destiny: Kim Beeman said she has a working installation -- which I look forward to seeing when I get to Bangkok next.  I always envisioned it for primary, but several people warned me that it doesn't work reliably with kids younger than seven or so -- as their fingerprints are too soft? unformed?  Others also mentioned parental concern over storing biometric data of children.\n\nBook Weeks.... listened to others discussing what they do.  What we all do is cram a lot into one week.  Why not make every week \"book week\"?  Spread out more author visits over time, matching the right author to the right age level during the right curriculum time.  World Book Day in April could be the excuse for the whole campus to dress up as a book character.  The UN provides enough days throughout the year to focus on (especially for us as we aren't a nation-based school), e.g., World Literacy Day, Mother Tongue Day, etc.\n\nEngaging readers.... Lots of good ideas and\n\nresources\n\n.\n\nCollection development...\n\nDitto\n\n.\n\nAudiobooks and e-books....  A topic we all have \nopinions about and experiences with, e.g., Shrewsbury has Overdrive, so \nwe were quizzing Kim Beeman.  Many of us have FollettShelf, Bookflix, \nand TumbleBooks.   Barb Philip shared\n\nthe wealth of her experiments\n\nin her primary school library.\n\nStyle of PD.... this small group worked well.  I'm now thinking our network in Singapore (ISLN) should go for one-day Bootcamps designed for no more than 50 participants at a time, on various topics, e.g., on graphic design and signage, copyright, RDA and cataloging, managing genres and the trend to genre-fication, etc. -- for all library staff.\n\nNext year LKSW might be in Bangkok..... ?\n\nPhoto above:  a snapshot of the fabulous biscuits made specially for the conference!",

      "title": "ALA Las Vegas: Take-aways from being with 25k+ librarians for a couple of days",
      "content": "The\n American Library Association's annual conference is a heaving mass of \nlibrarians (of all varieties) in one place for four days - \nFriday-Monday, June 26-30.  Almost any US city is a convenient stopover for me, heading to Maine, at the end of the school year.\n\nThis year ALA was in Las Vegas, a venue that lived up to its stereotype, in the eyes of a first-time visitor. Next year's location - San Francisco - will be more my style perhaps.\n\nBut ALA is always an enriching experience, no matter where it's held.\n\nThe problem is to figure out\n\nwhat\n\nand\n\nwho\n\nyou want to see in the small time and huge space of the event (the exhibition hall alone is worth four days).\n\nYou\n can search offerings and construct your own schedule online ahead of \ntime -- and there is a mobile app -- but the lack of fast/reliable/free \ninternet access (especially Sunday) made that fairly irrelevant.  And \nfor those of us with overseas phone accounts, the smart-phone solution \nfor internet data access wasn't very economical.  So making off-line \nlists and lugging around the fat, physical ALA Guide was a sad, but \ncomforting, necessity.\n\nHere is my public debrief of the conference, filtered through my international, K-12 (primarily middle/high) librarian focus :\n\nPre-Conference: SCHOOL VISITS\n\nThere was a half-day pre-conference event on Friday, visiting three independent (i.e., private) school libraries --\n\nAlexander Dawson School\n\n,\n\nFaith Lutheran Middle and High School\n\n, and\n\nLas Vegas Day School\n\n.  A few photos of each are\n\nhere on Flickr\n\nwith notes below.\n\nAlexander Dawson\n\n:\n\n--\n the librarian pointed out how, in designing the school, no electrical \ncables or wiring is hidden, so kids are very aware of where electricity \nis being used, e.g., for air conditioning, for internet access, etc.;\n\n-- the library had\n\nan \"Aurasma\" wall\n\n-- where we could pick up iPads, scan images, and watch videos the kids had made for one unit of inquiry (e.g., Irish castles);\n\n--\n two authors a year do two-week residencies, including 2 days in each \nclassroom, e.g., Brian Falkner (from NZ) and Paul Owen Lewis -- during which time \neach student creates a book;\n\nFaith Lutheran:\n\n--  had quite a few full-size physical displays, e.g., military uniforms and a skeleton;\n\n--  had\n\nan author/illustrator wall\n\n, where each visiting celebrity's name is added each year;\n\nLV Day School\n\n:\n\n--\n they offer a \"Classic Reader\" program -- where \nstudents read more \"quality\" literature, and then discuss with an adult, four books above and beyond\n their other reading;\n\n-- they run an \"Adopt a Shelf\" program for \nparents -- where parents are responsible for re-shelving and keeping one\n shelf looking tip-top -- they say it's quite competitive!\n\nOverall,\n questions focused on staffing (all were minimally staffed, \nsurprisingly) and what they were doing for ebook provision (e.g., all \nhad Overdrive, despite the fact the local library offers it -- though not sure \nif that affected their choice of titles -- would they try to avoid \noverlap?).\n\nNETWORKING\n\nThis is no small part of ALA.   Many of us \ninternational school librarians managed to find each other (and we are \ndetermined to make it more organized next year).\n\nThe \nfour of us from Singapore (Kim Klein from Stamford American \nInternational School, Kate Brundage from Singapore American School, and \nSusanne Clower and I from United World College of Southeast Asia - East \ncampus) arrived as a nucleus -- and soon found Leanne Mercado from \nNishimachi International School (Tokyo), as well as Candace Aiani and \nBarb Middleton from Taipei American School.  Later we connected with \nLeslie Henry from Jakarta International School and Victoria Robins from \nASF Guadalajara Mexico.  There were others on the list of international \nattendees, but poor connectivity (and our overseas phones) made it hard \nto communicate.  I kick myself that I didn't put out a general call on \nthe social media channels (like the ECIS iSkoodle listserv) beforehand.\n\nDuring the pre-conference session of school visits, while getting on or off the bus, I overheard one woman say \nthe word\"Sakura\" -- and I quickly determined to talk to her at the next stop, \nknowing she must have been referring to the\n\nJapanese international school librarian book award program\n\n, which is how I met Leanne Mercado.  Only when I later I put a face on the name\n \"Barb Middleton\" did I realize that she was on the same Friday school \nlibrary tour, but because her registration tagged identified her as \nbeing from Minnesota, I didn't realize she was one of us - from Taipei \nAmerican School.\n\nThose of us that managed to meet up \ndid our best to \"divide and conquer\" in terms of session attendance.\n\nTO DO:\n\nFinish de-briefing with those who attended this year, especially my Singapore colleagues when we all get back in August;\n\nNext year: advertise on social media for all going to ALA to connect ahead of time;\n\nNext year: maybe have a group of us do a panel presentation on \nInternational School Librarians - as an employment opportunity - pluses \nand minuses, etc.\n\nEBOOKS\n\nA big complaint about\n\nOverdrive for schools\n\nhas been the annual fee -- as much as \nUS$4k/yr in the past.  But at their ALA booth, an Overdrive \nrepresentative confirmed they have recently lowered the cost for school \nlibraries.  Now it is US$1k/yr for up to 999 students and US$2k/yr \nfor up to 1,999 students.  This cost is content \npurchase per annum -- it's not an annual usage fee -- which is great.\n\nFor\n those of us in international schools, a ongoing issue with all ebook \nvendors has been digital rights management (DRM) -- where popular titles\n are often not available to us, being situated outside the countries \nthat are the biggest publishers (USA, UK, Australia, etc.).  I asked the\n Overdrive rep where I could preview the titles actually available to us\n in Singapore -- and she suggested I contact the sales force and get \naccess to a demo overseas account.\n\nStarWalk KidsMedia\n\nis a new ebook vendor -- headed by the famous (and charming) non-fiction author for kids,\n\nSeymour Simon\n\n(and his wife).  500 titles available so far, for grades K-8, half fiction, half non-fiction.  Leveled according to Fountas and \nPinnell.  Only US$895 a year (at least for big schools like ours -- I \nforget if it's cheaper for smaller schools.)  Unlimited, simultaneous \naccess.  Device neutral -- in fact, they assured me that if users \ndownloaded a title (as you have to do to read on a mobile device), the \ntitle will stay accessible on the device for as long as the subscription\n (e.g., a year).  And they will provide MARC records.  It sounds a lot \nlike\n\nBookFlix\n\n--\n but going as high as Grade 8 in interest and complexity.  They were \nhappy to offer us a 1-month free trial -- which I intend to do.\n\nKindle, Kindle, Kindle....?\n\nCandace Aiani (High School) and Barb Middleton (Primary School) have \nembarked wholeheartedly on a Kindle-loaning program at Taipei American \nSchool - and have a wealth of experience.  Back in February she put a \ncall out to the\n\nSILCAsia listserv\n\n, starting a discussion on the management of Kindles in schools - which some of you may have seen.\n\nThey\n organize their Kindles into \"pods\" of 5 devices each -- as each Kindle \naccount can be synced to five devices.  Each Kindle (in a pod) will have\n up to 30 titles or so on it.\n\nClick here to see\n\nwhat a search for \"Kindle\" and \"pod\" turns up in Candace's High School catalog.\n\nClick here to see\n\nwhat\n one Kindle might have on it, e.g., Pod \"I\".  (Now that Kindle Unlimited\n has been launched, I wonder how many of their titles are available to overseas subscribers.)\n\nTaipei American School has gone for Overdrive in a big way --\n\nsee their Overdrive homepage\n\n-- even though the Overdrive books can't be downloaded to overseas \nKindles, they said.  They also aren't thrilled about the fact there is \noften a 6-month delay getting the latest titles into Overdrive.  Note: Barb affirms that FollettShelf is far easier for primary school students to use than Overdrive.\n\nTO DO:\n\nContact sales@overdrive.com and ask for access to a demo overseas \naccount -- now that the Overdrive annual fee is reasonable for school \nlibraries -- for secondary school.\n\nStart 1-month free trial in September of StarWalk KidsMedia -- for primary school.\n\nGAMING / COMPUTING FOR KIDS\n\nJane McGonigal was the opening \nkeynote for ALA -- and didn't disappoint.  She reminded us of all the \npositive emotions gaming releases:  CREATIVITY / CONTENTMENT / AWE + WONDER / EXCITEMENT / CURIOSITY / PRIDE / SURPRISE / LOVE / RELIEF / JOY.\n\n-- not to mention the development of RESILIENCE.\n\nI was glad to be reminded of\n\nher experience developing a game for the New York Public Library\n\nand the quote by Brian Sutton-Smith:\n\n\"The opposite of play isn't work.  It's depression.\"\n\nLater, in the exhibits hall, I ran into\n\nScott Nicholson\n\n,\n professor at the iSchool in Syracuse and expert on gaming -- (I \nattended one of his workshops last year at ALA) -- and was thrilled to \nhear he is due to come to Singapore in November to work with the \nNational Library Board (NLB).  Scott did several sessions at ALA this \nyear -- and is particularly keen on the cognitive benefit of creating \ngames, not just playing them.   Read some of his past papers\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nIn the course of our conversation, he also alerted me to the\n\nMath Fairs\n\nfor students being held annually in Toronto -- which I could definitely see our campus implementing.\n\nThere was also a Poster session on Computational Thinking for Tweens and Teens -- see\n\nhttp://ala14.ala.org/node/14901\n\nwhere you can download the four PDFs.  It's where I came across\n\nCubelets\n\n....\n\nTO DO:\n\nConnect with Scott Nicholson before November -- and with the NLB -- and see if I can organize an\n\nISLN\n\nor school event as well when he is there.\n\nTalk to Tilson Crew, our primary school math coach, to learn more \nabout the math games that she has created and made available in our \nprimary library for borrowing.\n\nTalk to all our math teachers about the possibility of getting a math fair going at our school.\n\nREADING\n\nALA is one big reading-love-fest.  Everyone there is \nfull of book-talk, whether ebook or pbook.  And walking down the aisles \nof the exhibition hall, I just kept snapping photos of book covers, if \nnot picking up free ARCs.  I refuse to fetishize signed editions, making\n it easy to avoid the urge to join any queues in front of author booths \nin the exhibition hall -- though I thoroughly enjoyed the chance to chat\n with authors when given the casual chance, e.g., attending a reception \nwith the author/illustrator Kevin Hawkes who happens to live in Gorham, \nMaine, one town over from my hometown.\n\nDonalyn Miller\n\n, aka The Book Whisperer and Grade 5 teacher extraordinaire, gave a talk on\n\n\"Fostering Positive Reading Identities\"\n\n. \n I was sitting between two international primary school \nteacher-librarians (Leanne Mercado from Tokyo and Barb Middleton from \nTaiwan) and we just kept nodding and laughing as Donalyn enlightened us \nwith her research and entertained us with her personal experiences as a \nreader and reading teacher.\n\nLike\n her, my identity as a reader was clinched in 3rd grade thanks to \"SRA\" \n-- that popular color-coded series of comprehension exercises in a box \n(which introduced me to speed reading as a competitive sport) -- and a \nmemorable teacher, Miss Poole, who not only read \"Charlotte's Web\" to \nus, but also the delightful (though 1950s antiquated) \"Mrs. Piggle \nWiggle\" series of magic solutions.\n\nDonalyn talked about\n the power of reading communities and reiterated the influence of book \n\"commercials\" arising out of the natural community (e.g., peer-to-peer \nrecommendations) -- and the role modeling of being a reader and \nread-alouds -- and all the things we know and have been doing, but need \nto remember are terribly inter-connected and important.\n\nShe\n challenges her students to read 40 or more books a year -- without any \nother reward system.  (Reading is its own reward, as she says.)\n\nShe talked about the intersection of reading interest (\n\nmotivation\n\n), reading level (\n\nability\n\n), and background knowledge (\n\nfertile ground for understanding\n\n) in terms of book choice.  Which makes me think of my beloved Design Thinking intersection of\n\ndesirability\n\n(are you interested in the topic?),\n\nfeasibility\n\n(does it match the assignment?) and\n\nviability\n\n(do we have the resources to support you) -- relating to research questions.\n\nThough\n when it comes to reading levels, she reminded us that lexiles are only \nscaffolds (e.g., Fahrenheit 451 and The Diary of a Wimpy Kid \nhave the same lexile band (true??)) -- and that text complexity is about what is NOT found on the page.\n\nShe recommends having a small pile of \"Special Class Books\" -- ready to hand to any child who says they have no book to read.\n\nI\n like her idea of \"Epicenter Readers\" -- that category of people\n who influence other people's reading, whether in the classroom or in life.  Her own include John Schumacher \n(@mrschureads) and Teri Lesesne (@professornana).  I happened to meet two long-standing online \"Epicenter Readers\" of my own at a Random House reception:  Lynn Rutan and Cindy Dobrez (aka the\n\nBookends\n\nbloggers) -- and gushed over them like a proper groupie.\n\nDonalyn also reiterated the wisdom that less-than-highbrow series helps develop readers.  They are not to be sneered at.  Neither is the habit of re-reading.  As she reminded us, close reading is re-reading with a purpose.\n\nTO DO:\n\nContribute to Donalyn's Nerdy Book club blog\n\nDon't miss her regular Twitter chats, e.g.,\n\n#bproots\n\n- on roots of best practice for literacy teaching\n\nI\n\nNFORMATION LITERACY and THRESHOLD CONCEPTS\n\nThere\n are so many information literacy sessions to attend at ALA, some \nschool-focused, some university-level.   As a high-school \nteacher-librarian, I am often indifferent to that distinction, as much \nof the information literacy instruction is focused on students just entering tertiary education.\n\nA big difference, however, is that \nschool-based librarians are almost all trained teachers, while \nuniversity ones aren't (necessarily).\n\nOne\n flipped university classroom session I attended was a bit of a waste, as it mainly\n extolled the benefits of using curriculum design models in designing \nflipped courses, which any teacher-librarian would already appreciate. \n And I already knew about the handy tools for flipping the classroom \nbeing recommended, e.g., Screencastr, Prezi, Google Docs, etc.\n\nBut\n another session by university librarians teaching information literacy was brilliant in every way -- content, design, and presentation -- \"From Stumbling Blocks to Building Blocks: Using Threshold Concepts to Teach Information Literacy.\"\n\nSee\n\ntheir Powerpoint slides here\n\n.\n\nI’d read\n about threshold concepts, as defined by Meyer and Land \n(academic instruction experts) — and discussed by David Perkins (of \nHarvard fame and general teaching expert), before — but had never read or heard anyone talk about them with specific reference to the field of information literacy, which is what this panel of academic librarians did.\n\nKorey Burnetti, Amy Hofer, and Lori Townsend\n\nreviewed five characteristics of\n\nthreshold concepts:\n\nTransformative\n\n-- they change understanding\n\nIrreversible\n\n— one you get them, you can’t not see them anymore\n\nIntegrative\n\n-- part of a network of interconnected understandings\n\nBounded\n\n— meaning they are usually discipline-specific\n\nTroublesome\n\n— meaning often counter-intuitive\n\nThe metaphor of the threshold refers to the acquisition of these concepts -- which can be compared to crossing a border; a\n mental, liminal space, delimited by time and experience; an extended place where the novice transitions over time to being an expert, with some people getting stuck until they \"get it\" (learning bottlenecks), some roaming around inside indefinitely, perhaps never to emerge.  A lens is a popular metaphor for appreciating the power of threshold concepts in different disciplines - to see with the eyes of an expert.  (The transition from one side to the other also reminds me of the shift from slow thinking to fast thinking (System 1 and System 2) of Daniel Kahnemann et al.)\n\nSlide from the ALA 2014\n\npresentation\n\nThey then discussed some basic information literacy threshold \nconcepts they had distilled as \"enduring understandings,\" using the\n\nWiggins and McTighe model of backward design, for their teaching practice.\n\nFORMAT AS PROCESS\n\nINFORMATION AS COMMODITY\n\nAUTHORITY IS CONSTRUCTED + CONTEXTUAL\n\nMETADATA = FINDABILITY  (aka GOOD SEARCHES  USE DATABASE STRUCTURES)\n\nDATABASE = ORGANIZED COLLECTION\n\nPRIMARY\n SOURCES DEPEND ON PERSPECTIVE\n\nFor example, in exploring FORMAT AS THE RESULT OF A PROCESS, they showed the following typical search results, which to the average student would all look like \"websites\":\n\nSlide from the ALA 2014\n\npresentation\n\nGo read the seminal\n articles by Land + Meyer -- and other\n\nresources available on the wonderful webpage page of the three presenters:\n\nhttp://ilthresholdconcepts.com\n\n.\n\nAnother librarian showed how he promotes some of his library's more unusual digital collections as a means of exploring primary vs. secondary sources with students, e.g., presenting students with an \narchive of 1950s women’s magazines and having them imagine for what \nresearch question would particular advertisements or articles be a \nprimary source.  Showing how questions develop, to a large degree, from the resources being used - in an iterative cycle.\n\nThe mantra they left us with:  READ -- SHARE -- ACT.\n\nMany\n sessions were preceded by awards for best practice.  In the case \nof the Threshold Concepts one, an award was given to\n\nLibrary DIY\n\n(by Meredith Farkas) — a flipped classroom example of teaching \nprocedural (as opposed to conceptual) stuff.  I'd already starred the project in my Diigo bookmarks as something to emulate -- and was thrilled to see it so publicly recognized.\n\nThere was also a poster session on a website called InfoSkills2Go -\n\nhttp://infoskills2go.com/\n\n-- which allows college-bound high school students to earn badges in four categories:  academic integrity, information seeking, information organization, and information evaluation, using\n\nTRAILS\n\nas the pre-test and post-test.\n\nAnother poster session I missed was -- \"\n\nStudent to Superhero: Freshmen Tell Their Research Stories\n\n\" -- see\n\nhttp://bit.ly/studentsuperhero\n\n-- where they described how they had students create a graphical narrative using the software called\n\nComic Life\n\nto reflect on their entry-level university information literacy course.\n\nTO DO:\n\nRe-think my own teaching modules with these info lit threshold concepts in mind\n\nLook at the InfoSkills2Go website\n\nDISCOVERY (AND FAST CATALOGING)\n\nThere\n is a tension between the Google single box search — and the box (or boxes) we provide as windows into our local information resources.  Between what is out there in the largest sense of the world and what we can actually deliver (from our physical collection and our various virtual ones).\n\nCandace\n (of the Taipei American School) told me she has recently implemented \nthe\n\nEBSCO discovery layer\n\n.  I didn’t get a chance to really get into \nthis with her (which is why I am determined to get up to Taipei to spend\n concentrated time absorbing her school’s information environment and \nhow she is tackling these common problems of ours).\n\nIn\n terms of our library catalogs — Follett Destiny, for both Candace and \nme — the new Universal Search interface is an improvement (e.g., useful filtering via the sidebar).  But it's still slow and cumbersome compared to Google.\n\nShould we still be trying to steer students to our catalog?  What if we the library just focused on delivery of what students find elsewhere?  Leave the catalog there as our best inventory tool and perfect Subject Headings for our own discovery purposes, but not expect students to desert their best-friend Google?\n\n(NB: I've been heavily influenced by the thoughts of Aaron Tay (an academic librarian in Singapore) -- see this\n\nSept 2013 blog post\n\nof his and his ongoing\n\nFlipboard magazine on Web scale search and discovery systems\n\n.)\n\nTraditionally (think: paper card \ncatalogs) findability has depended upon controlled Subject Headings (e.g., \nLibrary of Congress (LCSH)), where each item would have no more than six\n \nhighly-faceted subjects\n\n(e.g.,  Indonesia - Relations - China - History)\n\n.  Nowadays, with \nfull-text searching and unlimited tags possible, controlled vocabularies are less important -- at least to users.\n\nThe single search box -- allowing for multiple fields and combination of terms to be searched at once -- demands a re-think of subject headings.  Which is why I've been following the FAST cataloging project for years -- and chose to attend the Faceted Subject Access Interest Group sessions at ALA this year.\n\nFAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology)\n\nAs much as RDA(1) is\n about moving bibliographic metadata forward, FAST cataloging is the cutting edge of subject heading progress.  Which is perhaps why it was standing room only in this session where Cornell University librarians (one of whom is a Discovery Metadata Librarian by title) relayed their experience as \nguinea pigs converting their data from LCSH to FAST — in collaboration \nwith OCLC Research (who were also in the room).  They're hoping to go live on July 1st.  (See\n\ntheir Powerpoint slides here\n\n.)\n\nA lot of the technical stuff was beyond me -- and the scale difference \nbetween Cornell’s converting their holdings and a school library like mine are enormous.\n\nBut I still got a lot out of the session -- and think we should be moving to FAST subject headings instead of Sears/LCSH.\n\nFacets can be in eight categories:  Personal names, Corporate names, Geographic names, Events, Titles, Time periods, Topics, and Form/Genre.\n\nThe FAST mindset was described as:\n\nUse what you find\n\nSubjects do not cross facets, e.g., you can't have \"Italy - History\"\n\nObserve difference between topical and genre/form facets\n\nFewer application rules, e.g., the order of headings is not significant, no constraints on combinations of topical and geographic terms\n\nDates can be whatever you need to assign, e.g., \"1992-2011\" is fine if that's what the resource covers\n\nThe elephant in the room, they admitted, is that, if FAST is so great, why isn't everyone rushing to use it?  Will it replace LCSH?  Only time will tell.\n\nWatch this space.\n\nLinks re FAST:\n\nALCTS: FAST for cataloging and discovery\n\n- newsletter\n\nOCLC FAST

matter that my library is theoretically all built now.  I went to a session on\n\n“Science + Form = Function: The Impact of Neuroscience on Architecture and Design”\n\n-- a subject for which is there is an Academy -- see\n\nhttp://www.anfarch.org/\n\nand especially their recommended reading list:\n\nhttp://www.anfarch.org/recommended-reading/\n\n.\n\nThe session opened with a quote from Winston Churchill who said, \"We shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us.\"\n\nThe speakers talked about the\n\nten\n\nsenses:  touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight.... plus\n\npressure\n\n,\n\nbalance\n\n,\n\ntemperature\n\n,\n\nmotion\n\n, and\n\npain\n\n.\n\nImagine a grid where these ten senses are the y-axis.  Then put these\n\nlibrary space functions\n\nacross the x-axis:\n\nassembly\n\n,\n\ncontemplation\n\n,\n\ndata collection\n\n,\n\npresentation\n\n,\n\nreading\n\n,\n\nrefuge\n\n,\n\nretreat\n\n,\n\nstorage\n\n,\n\nstudying\n\n, and\n\nteaching\n\n.  Consider the intersection of each -- and decide priorities and possibilities.\n\nWe need to consider the intersection of three things:  Behavior, Experience, and Brain Activity in a space like a library.\n\nSpeakers talked of Inspiration, Trust, and Empathy, as well as Symbolism, Wayfinding, and Exploration -- linking hand, brain, and symbol.  They asked us to consider what Affordances the library provides, to invite or indicate desired actions -- and the tension between Function and Representation (symbolism) in our spaces.\n\nFrankly, I didn't get any practical inspirations from the session, but felt mentally stretched from sitting through it.\n\nMeanwhile some other teacher-librarian\n went to a discussion meeting (one of those smaller things in the \nschedule that you could miss in the blink of an eye, unless you were \nobservant) on The Information Commons.  Of all the things I was listening for \nin her brief summary in the time we had for debrief, I latched onto her \nreporting of someone who had “pink things hanging from the ceiling” that\n absorbed sound.  The ALA notes on this meeting also mention \"pink noise machines\" (\n\nsee here\n\n). I am now searching for this mysterious product/item.  \n(Contact me if you can help!)  (Could the person have been talking about \"pink noise\" - in contrast to \"white noise\" --\n\nsee distinction here\n\n-- instead of something literally pink?)\n\nAcoustics is my ongoing elephant in the room and I am on the lookout for all \nameliorating accessories.  (Over the summer there are ceiling/wall \npanels being installed in my library — wish I had done my \npre-installation research benchmarks and logged some decibel stats….)\n\nThere was a poster session I really wanted to attend, but missed --\n\nLibrarian Design Share: Inspiration for Library Creatives\n\n.  On the other hand, the beauty of the best poster sessions is that the poster itself is posted online and tells it all -- see\n\nhttp://ala14.ala.org/files/ala14/LibDS-ALA-Poster-FINAL.pdf\n\n-- and their website --\n\nhttp://librariandesignshare.org/\n\n-- is a treasure-trove.  The session description mentions they would be giving visitors \"design strategy cards\" -- I wonder if they pointed people to\n\nthe \"Design with Intent\" toolkit\n\n, which I love.\n\nAnother poster session I missed was\n\n\"Gearing Up for College\"\n\n-- about university libraries reaching out to low-income middle school children who excel in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) fields.  Interestingly, they used a map activity to get the students to observe what was going on in the university library -- and hopefully to get interested in what they were observing.  (Reminds me of the ALA program session I attended last year -- where Andrew Asher described having students create color-timed cognitive maps of the library -- see\n\nhttp://www.andrewasher.net/BiblioEthnoHistorioGraphy/category/mapping/\n\n.  A fascinating way to make the virtual visible.... )\n\nTO DO:\n\nTrack down \"pink noise things\"\n\nContribute to\n\nhttp://librariandesignshare.org/\n\nMakerspaces\n\nMakerspaces is definitely still a hot topic for libraries.  I did a full-day pre-conference last year at ALA on them, and knew I was going to a four-day\n\n\"Constructing Modern Knowledge\"\n\nsummer institute in New Hampshire, July 8-11, which would be completely about making things (watch for another blog post eventually), so I didn't bother to attend maker-related sessions at ALA.\n\nAs my school already has an extensive Design and Technology department and set-up (with 3D printers, laser cutters, et al.), I'm thinking the library should focus on making to do with books -- like setting up a Writing Center (a project several of us have been trying to get off the ground for three years now) and promoting Book Art.\n\nOne poster session was about an annual RE:BOOK altered book contest -- at the Claremont College Libraries.\n\nSee the PDF here\n\n.  What a great way to re-purpose donated books -- of which I have plenty.\n\nTO DO:\n\nConnect with the art teachers and get some regular altered book art going -- perhaps with a permanent book art workspace in a corner of the library -- or up on the Art Floor.  I like the idea of an annual contest.\n\nPDA (Patron Driven Acquisition)\n\nWhen I hear \"PDA,\" I still think of \"public display of affection\" -- something every high school librarian deals with every day.  But it's the latest term for users letting us know what they want (starting from that good 'ole book suggestion form) -- and it goes hand-in-hand with a good collection policy.\n\nThere were several small sessions on PDA as it relates to e-book and video purchases, e.g., see\n\nhere\n\n,\n\nhere\n\n, and\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nCandace was telling me how she has instituted an online ticketing system for all library requests -- whether book purchase recommendations or queries about database passwords, etc.  I forget the name of the software package she said she bought, but it is one where people can search the database, to see the status of their problem or request.  Our Facilities and IT Depts both use a basic ticketing system, but we users don't have the ability to search their records.  Must look into it for our library.  I know there are requests that fall off my radar.....\n\nThe Latest and the Greatest: ARCs and Awards\n\nFor school librarians, there are two important annual lists that get announced at ALA.\n\nBest Apps for Teaching and Learning\n\nBest Websites for Teaching and Learning\n\nALA is also a place to pick up Advanced Reader Copies of books.  I try not to go crazy.\n\nHere are a few I picked up:\n\nJared Diamond's \"The Third Chimpanzee\" - Young Readers edition\n\nFrank Einstein and the Anti-matter Motor - by Jon Scieszka\n\nHold Tight, Don't Let Go - by Laura Rose Wagner - a YA novel re Haiti and the earthquak\n\nVango - by Timothee de Fombelle\n\nImaginary - by A.F. Harrold, illustrated by Emily Gravett\n\nThere Will Be Lies - by Nick Lake\n\nYoung Houdini - by SImon Nicholson\n\nThe Wollstonecraft Detective Agency - by Jordan Stratford\n\nOn a Clear Day - by Walter Dean Myters\n\nA Path Appears - by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl Wu\n\nNotes:\n\nLast\n year at ALA I did a full-day pre-conference on RDA (Resource \nDescription + Access).  What I immediately love about RDA is its simple hierarchy, distinguishing between Work, \nExpression, Manifestation, Item (WEMI), not to mention its elaboration of \ndates — so one can distinguish between work creation date, original \npublication date, particular edition date, and manufacture date.\n\nPhotos:\n\nSRA:\n\nhttp://allaboutthe1970s.blogspot.com/2010/04/i-remember-those.html",

      "content": "\"We have a responsibility to introduce children to things they don't yet know they will love.\" -- Edith Ackermann\n\nDr. Edith Ackermann\n\ncame onto my radar this summer.   (See\n\nmy previous blog post on \"Constructing Modern Knowledge 2014\"\n\nfor the context.)\n\nSuch a charming, thoughtful expert on play and learning.  And\n\nsuch credentials!\n\n-- she worked with Jean Piaget and Seymour Papert, and has been associated with MIT for years (as well as other universities).\n\nShe loves\n\nReggio Emilia schools\n\n,\n\nSteiner/Waldorf schools\n\n,\n\nKatie Salen and Quest schools\n\n, and\n\nFreinet schools\n\n.  A true educational radical (or realist) -- depending on where you stand.\n\nRead this recent interview with her on creativity, talent, and intuition\n\n-- in a journal aimed at architects.\n\nI wish I could find her CMK14 slides online.  I took basic shots into my Penultimate notes, but they aren't good enough to reproduce, e.g.,\n\nThe part of her talk that interested me the most was her description of\n\nthe iterative cycle of self-learning\n\n, which she outlined as:\n\nConnect\n\n-- Wow! I can't believe...  -- the inspiration - the imaginarium\n\nConstruct\n\n-- hands-on -- the atelier -- immersion and innovation\n\nContemplate\n\n-- heads-in -- mindfulness -- the sanctuary or secret garden\n\nCast\n\n-- play-back -- re-visit -- stage -- dramatize -- experiment\n\nCon-vivire\n\n-- the sharing -- the piazza -- the agora -- expressivity\n\nShe stressed these are just guidelines for what happens along the way in different ways -- that the stages should never be used prescriptively.\n\nOur school is just settling on some common terminology around\n\na research model\n\n-- one that will be differentiated for Infant (K1 to Grade 1), Junior (Grade 2 to Grade 5), Middle School (Grade 6 to Grade 8) and High School (Grade 9 to Grade 12).\n\nA midway meeting ground has been agreed, e.g., here is a standard arising out of the articulation of the middle school curriculum:\n\nThe blog \"What Ed Said\" (Edna Sackson) recently had a post\n\non her frustration with expected slavish commitment to an inquiry cycle  model.  I agree.  You might as well insist everyone follow the same  sequence for falling in love or grieving over death.  It's useful to  appreciate typical stages, but impossible to expect everyone to adhere  to them.  NB:  Kath Murdoch, referenced by Edna, is a frequent professional visitor to our school, and\n\nher phases of inquiry\n\nwere key inputs to our process -- see here:\n\nEdith was talking about\n\nPlay\n\n-- and undoubtedly about\n\nInquiry\n\n.  But our school is talking about\n\nResearch\n\n.  Are they all the same thing?  Just at different age levels?  We'd like to think so.\n\nResearch, for middle/high school students, is just a game with adult rules (e.g., alluding to the ideas of others in a constructive and respectful way) -- and our job is to alert them to those rules and to convince them it's a game worth learning (after all, research is a form of adult fun, yes?).  As Edith put it, students must learn to add value in the process of borrowing.   They must become adept at massaging ideas until they are their own, rather than just functioning as an information broker, passing on ideas.  To ride others' ideas until they can feel in solo mode, not fusion mode.\n\nI particularly like Edith's \"Cast\" phase, with its implicit theatrical connotation.  Something between our \"Reflect\" and \"Communicate.\"  It's the part that implies the iterative nature of the process.  That you, within your own mind or in the presence of others, re-think what you have, try it out, and ask if it's sufficient, if it's enough.\n\n(I'm also partial to Design Thinking as a basic research model; see my previous blog post:\n\nCarol Kuhlthau Meets Tim Brown\n\n. )\n\nOther things Edith commented upon....\n\nre MOOCs and online learning:\n\nthe double standard:  it's the new entrepreneurial elite, who are educated onsite with constructivist methods, who are promoting education online where \"others\" struggle alone;\n\nre today's learners:\n\ngrowing older younger, and staying younger older;\n\nthe tension between temp and \"forever\" work\n\nthe tension between professional mobility and lack of security;\n\nre the role of the eye and the senses:\n\naway from Piaget (the rationalist) to Papert (feeling the materials);\n\nthe real practitioners (e.g., architects) are always tricking people to get a different perspective;\n\nto crawl out of the old ways of thinking;\n\ntricks to get us off our own beaten path;\n\nusing objects creates resistance;\n\n\"Learning is all about moving in and out of focus, shifting perspective, and coming to 'see anew.'\" -- Edith Ackermann",

      "content": "Gary Stager\n\nand\n\nSylvia Martinez\n\nhave been holding a very special 4-day summer institute in New Hampshire for the past 7 years.\n\n\"\n\nConstructing Modern Knowledge\n\n\" (\n\n#CMK14\n\n) provides teachers with a learning space and enough time to the fail -- and succeed -- at doing what we are always exhorting our students to do:  learn something!  make something!\n\nI got involved by virtue of having put Stager and Martinez's book --\n\n\"Invent to Learn: making, tinkering, and engineering in the classroom\"\n\n-- on display in my library to coincide with the\n\nLearning 2.0\n\nconference last October (see my\n\nprevious blog post\n\non it).\n\nBrian Smith\n\n(from Hong Kong International School) immediately began to talk to me about the book -- and the related conference.  Considering I spend my summers in Maine (a stone's throw away), it wasn't hard to decide to sign up.  At\n\n21st Century Learning\n\nin HK in December, I also had the opportunity to meet Gary, who exudes enthusiasm for messy learning and hard fun.\n\n4 days, 180 participants.  You can see\n\nthe Vimeo videos here\n\nand\n\nthe Flickr group photos here\n\n.  All in a Radisson Hotel in ManchVegas.  (Yes, I guess that's what they call Manchester, NH -- as it's the region's hotspot.)\n\nWho were we?  The informal hands-up survey at the beginning indicated mainly teachers from private schools, from all over the US, plus a few internationals.  I quickly found\n\nTina Photakis\n\n, from Australia, to hang out with.  The crowd was seeded with plenty of highlighted helpers, like\n\nBrian Smith\n\n(and his daughter), young\n\nSuper-awesome Sylvia\n\nTodd (and her father),\n\nPeggy Sheehy\n\n(one of the few librarians),\n\nDan and Molly Watt\n\n,\n\nCynthia Solomon\n\n, etc.\n\nHow did we decide what we were going to build in our 4 days?  By shouting out suggestions that got put on giant post-it notes on the wall, followed by a massive gallery walk and sign-up.  Then we gathered by our top favorite post-it -- and groups were formed.  It worked admirably, better than most unconference events I've experienced.  I loved the range of ideas:  a light-sensitive chicken coop, a robot \ndog, an interactive recycling bin,  an interactive tree, an interactive \ngarden, interactive clothing, etc.\n\nOne proposed project was \"wearable speakers\" -- and having attended two \nconferences this summer, I wish there were a smart-phone app for that right now.   How can\n it be that we don't have a way to make ourselves heard in big groups, e.g., questions from the floor, where no one can hear the question.\n\nI wanted to work on a noise meter of sorts, as I'd had a Design and Technology IB student create a (unfortunately non-working) prototype for my library, using an\n\nArduino\n\n.  So I knew I wanted to play with sound input creating some sort of visual output.  (Imagine: students in a supposedly silent study room with windows, where I am outside and can't tell how much noise they are actually making; when decibels go above a certain level,  colored lights began to flash -- indicating to both them and me that the room is no longer silent.)\n\nIn the end, I went with a group interested in \"sound sculpture\", which eventually split into three or four smaller groups.\n\nGordon\n\n,\n\nWendy\n\n, and I decided to see how we could get sound through an Arduino to display different colors, based on volume and frequency.  Gordon and Wendy wired the 3D matrix of lights, while I fooled around with programming an Arduino Esplora (a device which can take a variety of input).  We didn't get a fully-functioning integrated model, due to time and other limitations, but we sure learned a lot.  For me it was such a throw-back to my programming days.  Oh, the frustrations of imperfect code!\n\nA major highlight of the conference was a field trip to the fabled\n\nMIT Media Lab\n\n, thanks to Gary and Sylvia's connections.   A talk by Mitch Resnick, founder of the\n\nLifelong Kindergarten\n\ngroup.  (\n\nHere's a recent video of him doing a talk\n\nthat is similar to the one we heard - on Projects, Peers, Passion, and Play.)  A chat with 87-year-old\n\nMarvin Minsky\n\n, one of the three pioneers immortalized in the lobby of the impressive building, the other two being\n\nSeymour Papert\n\n(represented at CMK14 by his daughter, Artemis, and granddaughter), and\n\nMuriel Cooper, who died 20 years ago\n\n.\n\nMarvin regaled us with memories of his time at Bell Labs with Claude Shannon.  Re his artificial arm.  Though he lamented that no one wants to work -- nowadays -- on something so pedestrian as a former invention.  So no improvements are forthcoming.  He talked about being enthralled by nanotechnology.  The wave of the future.   He talked of computer games, and his belief that 4 year olds might play games, but 5 year olds should be moving on to making games.   His advice when getting stuck in life?  Ask the experts.  Which for him were Claude Shannon and Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nWe took advantage of the chance to wander down through the building.  So many windows into projects and the learning going on.  It was a wonderful evening in Cambridge/Boston.\n\nClick here to see all my photos\n\nof the conference -- including plenty taken inside the Media Lab.\n\nBack in Manchester, there was plenty of time for work, for reflection, and for inspiration from speakers interspersed in the schedule.\n\nEdith Ackermann\n\n, an MIT stalwart and \"play\" expert, gave a fascinating presentation.  She talked of so many things -- she deserves a separate blog post.\n\nPete Nelson\n\nis famous for building treehouses.  I didn't know about him before, but now I appreciate he has his own reality\n\nTV show, Treehouse Masters\n\nand\n\na treehouse center\n\nwhere you can go and stay.\n\nHe told the story of how his childhood passion for treehouses eventually led to a very public and remunerative vocation.  (Creating a coffee table book on treehouses of the world was an important first step!)  I'm sure most of us sitting there were thinking of old trees we wanted to create houses in.  He made it sound all so feasible.\n\nOverall take-away thoughts:\n\nRe the sharing of resources:  the organizers had an incredible array of materials available to us, but the trick was, whatever we took, we needed for the four days.  There wasn't much that you just needed short-term access to.  So the sharing was limited.  I wondered how libraries with a makerspace would cope with this.  Would someone be able to check out or reserve, say, an Arduino Esplora, for three days?  What is realistic for what time period of exclusive use?  It makes me think that individual hardware, such as Raspberry Pi's and Arduinos, is better suited to a teacher-class situation, where a learner can work with one set of materials over time.\n\nHow best to handle differentiation?  In this situation, some of us at a table had NO experience, and some had CONSIDERABLE.   I was conscious of trying to balance the time I spent floundering on my own and the time I spent getting help from others.  One thing for sure: we were in charge of our own learning.  It was fascinating to wander around, seeing the vast range of projects and skills on display.\n\nCMK library:  There was a room at the conference where Gary and Sylvia laid out all their personal collection of books related to making and creating.  I took photos of most of them -- and have searched Amazon, making a \"list\" of them.  See the\n\nbooklist\n\nhere:\n\nThe Maker Movement and Constructing Modern Knowledge\n\n.\n\nAlso\n\nsee this Reggio Emilia bookshop\n\nfor more.\n\np.s.  Just discovered Gary and Sylvia maintain their own recommended booklist on Amazon --\n\nsee here\n\n.\n\np.p.s.  Here's\n\nanother related booklist\n\n-- one from the\n\nInternational Design Technology teachers' conference\n\n, held at our school in May.  These were all the books I had on display during the conference.",

      "content": "A couple of days ago, someone on the US-based\n\nYALSA-BK listserv\n\n(yes, listservs are still active in many arenas -- even though other social media tools have arisen) suggested we crowd-source (amongst ourselves) lists of titles for MS/HS \"themed\" book talks.\n\nI'd been wanting to promote such lists to my students, but struggled to find a way to make the production process scaleable.  How to keep track of the books I booktalked as a themed grouping and continually promote the list.\n\nA few years back\n\nThe ReadAdventurer blog\n\npublished some \"walls of books\" -- see \"\n\n140+ Books for the Boys of YA\n\n\", \"\n\n120 YA books from the UK\n\n\", \"\n\n110+ Australian YA books\n\n\", and \"\n\nA Metric Ton of Short YA Books\n\n\" -- which I loved.  Then there were the online readers advisory tools like the\n\nNPR Book Concierge\n\n, which also shared booklists using book covers in a very visual way.  I wanted to find some vehicle to do the same thing -- generate lists based on themes -- but be visible in the library all the time.\n\nThen I found\n\n+Rebecca Dunham\n\n(blog -\n\nLunashee's Lunac\n\ny) and\n\nher YA themed posters\n\n(freely given away under Creative Commons).   Her posters inspired us to create our own, by providing some initial themes and a basic style to copy.  As we didn't have all the books on her posters, we simply modified the selection of titles to match our collection.\n\nLuckily I have a teacher, Mairin Raisdana, who works part-time in our library as our design and production queen; I just come up with the themes and titles I want to potentially booktalk.\n\nHere is\n\na Google Plus photo album of our posters\n\n, so far:\n\nAn important feature of every poster is both a QR code and a shortened URL (goo.gl or bit.ly) which takes viewers directly to the booklist in our Follett Destiny catalog.  So people can find out whether any copies are currently available in the library or not.  A majority of our high school students do have smart phones, but I also have a number of iPads that can be used as mobile OPACS and QR code scanners.\n\nBy linking to the catalog -- to a Resource List or to a search for particular key words or subject headings -- I can booktalk the books shown on the poster, but know there is a ready list of those books plus more -- to put into students' hands.  (Nothing worse than booktalking a stack of titles and not having enough to go around....)\n\nThe poster images are also available in our Libguides -- on a\n\nHigh School Reading Recommendations\n\nguide -- linking back to our catalog.\n\nPhysical copies of the poster are very important.  There's just so much in our libraries that is hidden online (or in our heads).\n\nIn the library itself wall space is limited.  So instead, we've got a circular rack of A3 (11\" x 17\") posters in plastic -- allowing patrons to browse the posters, like they would clothing.  The photos of our poster carousel are at the end of the slideshow above.  I've thought eventually I could get dividers on the rack, the equivalent of \"Size 8\", \"Size 10\", etc. -- \"Teacher Favorites\", \"HS Genres\", \"MS Genres\", \"Fiction\", \"Nonfiction\", etc.\n\nNote that the hanging posters are not laminated.  (Bad for the environment....) Instead they are put in re-usable stiff plastic sleeves.  This allows for easy updating of the display.  In the slideshow I include some pictures of what I buy here in Singapore, where they are called \"card cases\" or \"hard cases\".  I'm not sure what they would be called elsewhere (\"document cases\"?).  The coat/skirt hangers are from IKEA.\n\nOur school has a big Epson printer -- that allows us to produce posters \nthat are 1.x meters (3 feet+) in size.  So we can also put big-scale posters \nin hallways and on teachers' walls.  (As we encourage all teachers to \ngive us their list of favorite books -- from which we create a poster \nfor them.\n\nSee this previous blog post\n\n.)",

      "content": "The 2014-2015\n\nRed Dot Book Award\n\nshortlists, the 8 books in four age categories we choose for our students to read, consider, and compare -- in order to determine a favorite -- for a school and for the island nation of Singapore -- have been announced.  I want to celebrate them, but also point out the books that almost made it -- and still could in a future year -- and certainly deserve a wider reading in the meantime.\n\nYou can read the background to our awards and criteria in a blog post I did a year ago -- see\n\nLooking Back: the evolution of the Red Dot Book Awards and the Readers Cup in Singapore\n\n.\n\nBasically, we look at:\n\npublication date\n\n(past four years, e.g., 2011-2014)\n\n;\n\nease of access\n\n(where a paperback version via one of the free-shipping online vendors (e.g., Book Depository or Fishpond.sg) is the ideal -- and an ebook available is a bonus)\n\n;\n\ngenre\n\n(one nonfiction? one graphic format? one poetry or verse novel? as well as a mix of fiction genres)\n\n;\n\ngender\n\n(mix of female/male protagonists or appeal)\n\n;\n\ncountry of origin or flavor\n\n(wanting a mix, but recognizing some countries just produce a whole lot more than others, and preferring at least one book with a Singapore or Asian connection)\n\n;\n\nliterary vs. popular appeal\n\n(considering whether a book is already played out in terms of popularity or likely to be popular -- as well as books that teachers will love for their literary, teachable aspects);\n\nappropriateness for the age categories\n\nof our award.\n\ncontent\n\n, where we favor books with multiple possible connections -- text-to-text, text-to-self, and text-to-world.\n\nBalance trumps everything -- which means every year there are perfectly good books that don't get in the basket, because they unbalance it in some way.  With just 8 slots, we don't really want two wordless books or two poetry books or two biographical books, etc.  So I thought it would be good to lay out what is in this year's baskets AND highlight some books we seriously wanted, which lost out in some way, due to the devil of the balance.  NB: most of the un-chosen titles are theoretically still in the running for next year's lists....\n\nHere are this year's shortlists:\n\n2014-2015 Early Years\n\nISLN (Int'l School Library Network) Singapore's favorite books »\n\nShare\n\nbook reviews\n\nand ratings with ISLN (Int'l School Library Network), and even join a\n\nbook club\n\non Goodreads.\n\nOur international spread is pretty good:  2 USA, 1 Australia, 1 Iceland, 2 UK, 1 Canada, and 1 France.\n\nWe have one memoir (by Alan Rabinowitz, the large cat expert who suffered severe stuttering as a child, but found solace in speaking to animals --\n\nlisten to him tell the same story to grown-ups on this \"The Moth\" podcast\n\n).  One story of someone \"different\" finding a friend.  One non-fiction book of questions to consider, and a Peter Reynolds (of \"The Dot\" fame) story that considers creativity.  A beautiful French book which is a modern version of \"stone soup\".  A boy and his dog story that features learning Chinese.  A tale that connects creatures and humans from India all the way to Australia.  And a good-old-fashioned story of a young child befriending a lost lion, as well as a book by an Icelandic author where one unusual person finds a perfect match in another unusual person.\n\nClick here\n\nfor the longlist Early Years books we didn't choose\n\n...  including another French book (\n\nBear's Song\n\n), a lovely simple Korean bedtime tale (\n\nBlanket Travel\n\n); the perhaps too-well-known-already\n\nDay the Crayons Quit\n\n; the latest-greatest from Peter Brown (\n\nMy Teacher is a Monster\n\n); the rhyming fun of\n\nThe Brothers Quibble\n\nwhich wasn't readily available;

the knowing sarcastic humor of\n\nTimmy Failure\n\n; two realistic fiction verse novels we really liked:\n\n\"Words with Wings\"\n\nby Nikki Grimes, and\n\n\"Little Dog Lost\"\n\nby Marion Dane Bauer; a realistic fiction story of an Australian girl who goes to Pakistan with her parents to help flood victims (\n\nKelsey and the Quest of the Porcelain Doll\n\n); a cute graphic novel about people who don't fit in (\n\nOdd Duck\n\n); a realistic novel about an Omani boy about to move to the States (\n\nThe Turtle of Oman\n\n); a Singapore mystery/adventure novel in the vein of last year's Red Dot choice, Sherlock Sam (\n\nDanger Dan Confronts the Merlion Mastermind\n\n); a wordless book for older readers -- Aaron Beck's\n\nJourney\n\n; a light-hearted quest out of the UK:\n\nThe Magnificent Moonhare\n\n; scary stories from James Preller (\n\nHome Sweet Horror\n\n); the trials and tribulations of a 7-year-old (\n\nPenguin Problems\n\n);

NB:  In this category there are a lot....  We had a hard time selecting just eight.  So please -- go out and read all the ones listed here that we didn't choose.  They are worth it...  including the\n\nStar-Wars-meet-Cinderella dystopia\n\nset in Beijing, first in a sequence;\n\nOther Brother\n\nby Simon French; the\n\nUnwanteds\n\n(which won in the Morning Calm Medal in Korea); the\n\nadventure of escaping from a library\n\n; the\n\nbeautifully written and sensitive offering by Sonya Hartnett re WWII evacuees\n\n;\n\n\"A Time to Dance\n\n\" -\n\na verse novel about an Indian girl\n\nwho realizes she can dance even though she isn't whole (and several people have suggested\n\n\"The Running Dream\"\n\nas a perfect complement to it); a\n\ndystopia about British refugees struggling in France\n\nby Gillian Cross; a brilliant\n\nBritish gothic/horror fantasy\n\nset in the 19th century by Jonathan Auxier; a\n\nrealistic novel set back in the 1980s in India where boys struggle to become tiffin carriers\n\n; a moving middle-school novel about\n\na gifted and talented girl creating a family out of a group of misfits\n\n;\n\nRick Yancey's latest adventure\n\n; Gordon Korman's latest offering -- re an\n\nungifted boy\n\nwho ends up with the smarties and helps them develop in a different way; a\n\nnoble dystopia\n\npresented by Malorie Blackman;\n\n\"She's Not Invisible\"\n\nby Marcus Sedgwick -- such a strong contender -- with parallels to the beautiful\n\nPicture Me Gone\n\n; Jaclyn Moriarty's\n\n\"A Corner of White\"\n\n-- a parallel world fantasy;\n\n\"Hero on a Bicycle\"\n\nby the classic Shirley Hughes; \"Liar and Spy\" by Rebecca Stead -- too well known already by our students perhaps; Jared Diamond re-offering his\n\n\"The Third Chimpanzee\"\n\nin a young adult version;  Eoin Colfer launching a new series:\n\nThe Reluctant Assasin\n\n; the Indian mythology equivalent of Rick Riordan's Greek/Roman ones - the\n\nAsh Mistry series\n\n; a time travel book set during natural disasters of fire and water in Australia --\n\n\"The Four Seasons of Lucy McKenzie\"\n\n; and a book about Aussie soldiers and horses in WWI -- to complement Morpurgo's \"War Horse\" and Wolfer's \"Light Horse Boy\" --\n\n\"Loyal Creatures\"\n\nby Morris Gleitzman.\n\n2014-2015 Mature Readers\n\nISLN (Int'l School Library Network) Singapore's favorite books »\n\nShare\n\nbook reviews\n\nand ratings with ISLN (Int'l School Library Network), and even join a\n\nbook club\n\non Goodreads.\n\nOur international spread isn't bad: 3 USA, 1 Australian, 1 New Zealand, 1 India, 1 UK, 1 Pakistan.\n\nWe have the memoir of the youthful Nobel Peace Prize winner.  An unreliable narrator uncovering a mystery.  A historical novel set in Malaya during WWII and the region's post-war conflicts.  A novel within a novel -- giving us parallel worlds in more ways than one (and highlighting\n\nNaNoWriMo\n\nand the writing process).  A graphic rendition of the Ramayana from Sita's point of view.  An emotional (and visual) novel that examines cancer from the viewpoint of a teen whose mother is dying.  A post-apocalyptic survival novel set in Australia.  And an amusing and informative exploration of literary devices, all based on the nursery rhyme about three blind mice.\n\nClick here\n\nfor the longlist Mature books we didn't choose\n\n... including Meg Rosoff's\n\nPicture Me Gone\n\n- which everyone should read;  Sara Zarr's\n\n\"The Lucy Variations\n\n\" about the power of family and expectations, framed in the world of classical pianists; a\n\ngraphic version of war\n\nset in Uganda's LRA; an\n\nIndian novel about a girl's world\n\ncoming apart upon learning she is adopted; the Carnegie-awarding winning\n\n\"Maggot Moon\"\n\n;\n\ndragon slayers in Canada\n\n-- not to be missed;\n\ndesperate, lonely lives in Iceland\n\n;\n\nhistorical fiction from Australia\n\n(which proved hard to source, hence it had to be eliminated -- but worth finding);\n\n\"BZRK\"\n\nby the author of the popular \"Gone\" series; if you don't know Brandon Sanderson, then start with his\n\n\"Steelhearts\"\n\nre a future ruled by super-humans;\n\n\"I Kill the Mockingbird\"\n\n, a novel re 8th graders obsessed with making people obsessed with \"To Kill a Mockingbird\";\n\na novel about the endangered bonobos\n\nin the Congo; the multiple-award-winning\n\n\"Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe\"\n\n; and\n\nthe sins of the brother achingly explored\n\nby Susin Nielsen, author of \"Word Nerd\".\n\nWe'll be shifting our shortlist selection announcement time to June 1, rather than November 1 -- as we always underestimate how long it takes, which means libraries are delayed in getting books on the shelves.  So with any luck we will make this a spring task, rather than an autumn one.",
