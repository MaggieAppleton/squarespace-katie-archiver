del.icio.us

is one of those tools I couldn't live without.

In my main (personal/professional) account --

TheLibrarianEdge

-- I have over 1800 bookmarks to date, while in the account I recently set up for school --

UWCSEA

-- I'm only at a couple of hundred.

I use the school one to collect links for both students and teachers.  For instance, on my Grade 3 wiki, there's a page for the current unit of study,

Blue Planet

, which is about water -- where I have a link to my collection of bookmarks.   The distinction between links for students and links for teachers/parents is based on the tags I've assigned.  When I find a relevant website, I make "water" one of the tags and if it's particularly good for the students, I make "blueplanet" a tag.  That way I can show the kids the "

blueplanet

" links and the teachers the more complete list tagged "

water

".

Tag clouds shows the concentration of subjects -- and I've got two bundles of tags on my TheLibrarianEdge account:  Social Software and GreenWorld.

Definitely bother to install the buttons to make saving a link just a click away.

How it gets social is via the network feature.  In

my del.icio.us network

, you can see that I watch 19 people's bookmarks.  You can also see that I have 40 "fans" -- or people who have added me to their network.   Some of the relationships are mutual. And every now and then I check out my fans' bookmarks because I discover new people worth watching.

My network page is, in effect, an inbox of everything that my network has bookmarked recently.  So I can watch their activity.  This is a wonderful way to spend hours on the internet...
