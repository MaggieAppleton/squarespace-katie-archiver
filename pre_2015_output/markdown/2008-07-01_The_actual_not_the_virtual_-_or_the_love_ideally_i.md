Classroom teaching is a physical, breath-based, eye-to-eye                     event.

It is not built on equipment or the past.

It is not concerned about the future.

It is in existence to go out of existence.

It happens and then it vanishes.

Classroom teaching is our gift.

It’s us; it’s this.

Listening to

Margaret Edson talk about her love of classroom teaching

, it's not hard to understand her success as a playwright ("

Wit

" won the

1999 Pulitzer Prize

and was

filmed in 2001 by Mike Nichols

, a movie the critic

Roger Ebert recently mentioned

as one that hurt too much to watch now that he's had cancer himself).

Don't just read her speech -- watch her perform it.  Her delivery is dramatic, poetic, and funny. (I've already suggested her as a speaker for

a TED conference

.)

Her emphasis on the importance of the face-to-face interaction between teachers and students reminds me of one of my favorite poems --

"Did I Miss Anything" by Tom Wayland

-- subtitled, "Question frequently asked by students after missing a class".

Edson

spoke at Commencement Day at

Smith College

this past May -- her alma mater, and mine, which is how I came across her speech -- in one of those usually boring email bulletins.   Such graduation addresses aren't always so memorable, though two others I've bookmarked are:

JK Rowling on "The Fringe Benefits of Failure, and the Importance of Imagination"

at Harvard this year, and the comic writer

David Sedaris at Princeton back in 2006

.

Rowling's comments on the benefits of failure -- real failure -- makes me think of the need to welcome and recognize risk in our lives (read

The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable

by

Nassim Nicholas Taleb

).

Similarly, her comments on imagination -- that "what we achieve inwardly will change outer reality" -- reinforce Edson's message that

it's the journey, not the arrival, that counts in life

.  Edson claims she wrote her Smith college application essay on the theme, via Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Montaigne.  I've always preferred Cavafy's expression of it in the poem "

Ithaka

".

Edson is passionate about her job

as a kindergarten teacher and considers giving children the power to read as the best way she can change the world.

"Reading and writing is power--the thing that gives you the most power in your whole life. I like being part of students acquiring that power. I like handing that power over."
