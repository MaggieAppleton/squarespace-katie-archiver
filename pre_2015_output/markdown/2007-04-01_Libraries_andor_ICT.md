At the

IBAP teacher's convention

, each thread of the conference (e.g., Library, On-line Learning Communities, Applied Technologies in Instruction & Assessment, etc.) had a forum where we were asked to evaluate the ongoing issues in our area.

In the Library forum one outstanding issue raised was the relationship between school libraries and ICT.  Separate but equal? Collaborative partners? One and the same?

So it was nice to have

Stephen Heppell

(the man who is said to have put the "C" into ICT) rave about the importance of librarians in 21st century schools.

Librarians are clearly more important than head teachers.

Librarians are needed to thread and guide the components of the learning (because the ability is build a thread is what's valuable, it's about narrative connecting stuff).

The Internet is built all wrong -- it's focused on stuff, not on people.  What's important about a library is it's where people come together.  The staff are the asset, that's why the librarian is far more important than the books in a library.

On his website he has a page devoted to

Learning Places and Spaces -- virtual and actual

.  There's a lot there for anyone designing a library in the future.
