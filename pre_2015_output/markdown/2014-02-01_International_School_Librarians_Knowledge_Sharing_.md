A huge thank-you to Karli Downey and her team at Jerudong International School in Brunei for hosting a valuable two-day workshop for international school librarians, Feb. 21-22, 2014.  About thirty of us came together from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and Brunei to share our practice and thoughts.

See the

LKSW Libguide

for an overview.

The highlights for me included:

Lyn Hay

, from

SybaAcademy

and Charles Sturt University, spoke on the concept of the iCentre (

see her slides here

)

Read on: Mal Lee blog:

and "digital normalization"

Lyn Hay also spoke about

guided inquiry

-- and

Linda Twitchett (AISS) spoke

about how she developed a scope and sequence of information fluency for her secondary school.

As Lyn listed the

seven survival skills a la Tony Wagner

, I mentally tried to remember the 9 elements of our

UWCSEA profile

:  Qualities ( Commitment to Care, Principled, Resilient, Self-Aware) and Skills (Critical Thinker, Creative, Collaborative, Communicator, Self-Manager).  Information fluency/literacy is implicit in the descriptions of each.

Made me realize our library team needs to schedule time with our curriculum dept to continue to hash out our own research model.  Linda came up with four main stages:

Exploring

,

Investigating

,

Processing

, and

Creating

.  Our middle school has most recently settled on five stages:

Identify and ask relevant questions

Gather and organise information from different perspectives

Analyse, synthesise and evaluate information

Communicate

Reflection

Made me re-read my blog post on "

Carol Kuhlthau meets Tim Brown: Guided {Design} Inquiry

"

Lyn highly recommended Keri Smith's book,

How to be an explorer of the world

-- which is one of those books I hesitate to buy for the library, as it's meant to be written in and personalised.

Linda's Libguide on Research

Crys Mills reminded us of some great Australian picture books -- I put

the list here in LibraryThing

-- and will double-check we have them.

Library tech topics....

In the RFID discussion Rob George reminded us that RFID isn't sufficient for security, that most libraries still use magnetic strips for that.  We don't anticipate going to RFID though the self-check and ease of inventory are appealing.

Thumbprint (biometric) recognition for check-out with Follett Destiny: Kim Beeman said she has a working installation -- which I look forward to seeing when I get to Bangkok next.  I always envisioned it for primary, but several people warned me that it doesn't work reliably with kids younger than seven or so -- as their fingerprints are too soft? unformed?  Others also mentioned parental concern over storing biometric data of children.

Book Weeks.... listened to others discussing what they do.  What we all do is cram a lot into one week.  Why not make every week "book week"?  Spread out more author visits over time, matching the right author to the right age level during the right curriculum time.  World Book Day in April could be the excuse for the whole campus to dress up as a book character.  The UN provides enough days throughout the year to focus on (especially for us as we aren't a nation-based school), e.g., World Literacy Day, Mother Tongue Day, etc.

Engaging readers.... Lots of good ideas and

resources

.

Collection development...

Ditto

.

Audiobooks and e-books....  A topic we all have 
opinions about and experiences with, e.g., Shrewsbury has Overdrive, so 
we were quizzing Kim Beeman.  Many of us have FollettShelf, Bookflix, 
and TumbleBooks.   Barb Philip shared

the wealth of her experiments

in her primary school library.

Style of PD.... this small group worked well.  I'm now thinking our network in Singapore (ISLN) should go for one-day Bootcamps designed for no more than 50 participants at a time, on various topics, e.g., on graphic design and signage, copyright, RDA and cataloging, managing genres and the trend to genre-fication, etc. -- for all library staff.

Next year LKSW might be in Bangkok..... ?
