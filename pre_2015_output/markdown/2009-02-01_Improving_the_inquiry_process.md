Learning from peers is powerful -- in the classroom and in life.  I often get my share early on a Saturday morning, thanks to Skype and Beth Gourley, my friend and fellow teacher-librarian.  When our video cameras come into focus, the difference in our locations is obvious.  Beth, up in Tianjin, China, at this time of year is wearing a thick bathrobe and huddled under a duvet, while I, down in Singapore, lounge in sleeveless nightwear, cooled by a ceiling fan.

This week's treasures from Beth included an article she wrote last year for

KnowledgeQuest

called

"Inquiry -- The Road Less Travelled"

(Vol. 37, No. 1, Sept/Oct 2008) and some related photos.  Unfortunately, the article is not yet available online, but should be eventually (and you could always write

Beth

and ask her to send you a copy.... )

In the article she describes the

International School of Tianjin

(an

IBO

school) and how the teaching team there has worked on improving inquiry in the classrooms and library, starting with a group exploration of inquiry and information literacy models.

The result was a model adapted from three major sources:

the spiral of making personal meaning and understanding from Barbara Stripling (2003), guiding questions from Jennifer Branch and Dianne Oberg (2005), and language from Kath Murdoch (2005)

.  The secondary school version is shown above, and they have

a similar one with simplified questions for the elementary school

.

I especially love how teachers use the model as a framework for documenting the units of inquiry.  Here is an example from one of their Kindergarten classes (click to enlarge):

When Kath Murdoch came and worked with their teachers last year, they did a reflective exercise on their implementation of inquiry.  Here is a partial summary of the remarks collected (also taken from the article):

They go on to create the list (below left).

Nothing radical there -- everyone struggling to improve their inquiry will recognize the items as common goals.  Still it's good to be reminded of them.

Beth is also working on a wiki called

Research Story

, based on their inquiry model (which I trust she won't mind me sharing).  Like all wikis, it's a work in progress.  But I know it's made me want to go back and re-organize my own grade-level wikis around an inquiry model.

NB: The inquiry cycle image at the top was developed at the International School of Tianjin (IST) in 2007.
