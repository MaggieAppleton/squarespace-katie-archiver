A quote on books and reading that I'd never come across before:

To buy books would be a good thing if we also could buy the time to read them.

-- Arthur Schopenhauer

But I like the version of it quoted by

Gerrie Lim

, who credits Warren Zevon with this rephrasing of Schopenhauer:

We love to buy books because we believe we're buying the time to read them.

Which sums up how I felt when my kids were young and time was terribly precious -- I just had to keep buying books....
