If you're interested in literacies -- critical, new, or multiple -- and you don't know

Allan Luke

, then please watch

this webcast of him speaking about "New Literacies"

in Canada in May 2007, hosted by the Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat.  (Thanks to Susan Sedro for

pointing the link out on her blog

,

Adventures in Educational Blogging

...)

He's a huge presence on the literacy scene -- especially in Australia.  See, for example, this

list of literacy links, including Allan Luke's Four Resources model

, gathered by Rosemary Horton at the P.L. Duffy Resource Centre at Trinity College (Western Australia).

I'm also a fan of various colleagues of his over the years (all connected with Australia or Canada):

Colin Lankshear / Michele Knobel (see their blog,

Everyday Literacies

, as well as their book

New Literacies: everyday practices and classroom learning

)

Cushla Kapitzke

(at Queensland University of Technology, Australia)

Kieran Egan

(at Simon Fraser University, Canada)

It's interesting that Allan Luke has connections to Singapore as well.  He worked here for a few years (some time ago) and is the Foundation Dean, Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice, National          Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

In the webcast, Allan Luke mentions

Vivian Vasquez

-- a name I hadn't come across before in the field of critical literacy.   I'm pleased to see she has

plenty of podcasts

on critical literacy in practice to listen to.  Another lead to follow....
