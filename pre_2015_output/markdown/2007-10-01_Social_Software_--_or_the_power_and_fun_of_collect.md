Two major problems with the Internet are:

too much information

too many tools to choose from

Given that, it's best to think of an information problem as an excuse to play around with social software.

The problem Barb and I face -- with this workshop -- is how to organize the information we want to share with people while minimizing the "presentation" talking and maximizing the "hands-on" aspect.

For now, I'm going to blog about the kinds of problems social software has solved for me -- and we'll wait to figure out the best kind of online launch pad for the workshop.

PROBLEM:

How to get

photographs

online -- to share with others or simply to store for personal projects?

SOLUTION:

Use an online photo sharing site, like

Flickr

(see

How to Select a Photo Sharing Site for Newbies

).  Flickr has a tour available on its home page, which is one place to start.

Another way is to just start searching for photos on Flickr, e.g.,

photos tagged "Singapore"

or

photos including the word "Hmong"

.

Flickr also allows you to put photos in Sets and then to put Sets into Collections.  For instance, I have a Collection called

UWCSEA Primary Library

, which contains 8 sets, e.g.,

Writers' Camp 2007: Telunas Beach

and

07-08 UWCSEA Primary Library Displays

.  It's my way of recording what I do in the library. I have another collection called

Other School Libraries

where I keep sets of photos of libraries taken on professional peer visits.

NB: I can control who can see any photo by specifying its privacy level -- public, friend, or family.

By becoming "friends" with people and adding them to your Contact list, then you can automatically see when they upload new photos.   For instance, Barb just became a grandmother and when I login to Flickr, I can see

the latest photos she's uploaded of the baby

-- because she's one of my Contacts.

There are also Groups you can join.  I'm thinking of joining the

365 Library Days Project

-- where you are supposed to take one photo a day of your library for a year and post them on Flickr.  Search for groups that interest you.   Take a look at

all these Singapore groups on Flickr

.

How could Flickr be used in the classroom?  Read about

Photo Sharing in Education

in the

Teaching Hacks Wiki

(which has enough material there to keep you occupied for another Saturday or two).

People are doing

all kinds of fun stuff with Flickr

.  I like this "

Spell with Flickr

" application -- which takes text as input and gives you back photos that spell out the text, e.g.,:
