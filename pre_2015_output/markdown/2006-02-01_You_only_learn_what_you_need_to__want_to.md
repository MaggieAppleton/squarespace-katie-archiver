"I give them just enough technology to be able to navigate.  What they learn because they want to is much more effective than what I can teach."

-- Quote from

an article in Edutopia

re high school students learning to make films.

In this upcoming workshop Beth and I are doing, that's what we need to do:  whet the appetite of the teacher/librarians.  We don't have to be the experts -- we just need to tell the story of our own journey, in the hopes that it will make them want to explore the road themselves.

To be travel agents, not travel guides

-- as one article on teaching information literacy (which one was that?) put it.
