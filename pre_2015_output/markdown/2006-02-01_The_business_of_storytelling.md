Storytelling is a big story throughout the Internet. It's particularly interesting how business and marketing have taken it on board. See, for instance, this posting excerpt:

"Don't sell me a product, tell me a story!" from The Intuitive Life Business Blog

Marketing through telling stories doesn't stop there, it

infuses all that you do to market yourself and your business.

Consider two of my favorite business authors, Tom Peters and Jim

Collins. One of them is focused on participating in the business of

business, of sharing his evolving story and his view of which

businesses are and aren't successful, while the other is locked away in

his ivory tower, selling products and doing research that he'll share

when his next book is published. Which is which? You tell me: visit

Tom Peters' Web site

and

Jim Collins' Web site

for yourself. The difference is glaringly obvious.

Yes, the power of blogs is in the collaborative story.

From another business blog, another posting (

Naked Conversations: Story Telling v. Product Selling

) comes this comment about speakers at conferences and how the best ones tell stories:

Malcolm Gladwell was our favorite last year.  He was selling his book, but he didn't talk much about his book.

A case of showing what a good storyteller he was, rather than telling people he was. Of course, Gladwell has been a favorite of mine for years -- from the days when he was just in The New Yorker and I would rip his articles out to save.
