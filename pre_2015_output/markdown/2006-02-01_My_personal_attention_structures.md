Slowly but surely I am creating a constellation of attention structures that allow me to follow the plot on Web 2.0, Library 2.0, School Library 2.0, etc., adding up -- with any luck -- to School Librarian 2.0.    The cutting (librarian) edge story on information unfolding in the Attention Economy.

So this is the blog.

Then there's

my wiki

-- where I store the files I might reference here (like any papers I've written and want to share with people) -- as well as my bibliography of favorite writer/thinkers.  I'm using

pbwiki

for that -- and find it quite easy to use.  Can't say I've tried out every feature -- but there's plenty there to try.  My wiki is definitely still "under contruction"...

For bookmarking, I have an extension collection going over on

del.icio.us

What books have I read lately?  Check out my

Reader2

(that was "squared") site.  I'm trying out another "catalog your own books" program called

LibraryThing

where I track and tag books that could be used in the PYP programme -- e.g., tags based on the Learner Profile and the PYP Attitudes and Concepts.

I haven't really put up any personal photos yet.  Instead

Flickr

is where I'm storing photographs of primary libraries (ones I've worked at available to the public and ones I've just visited available just to friends).  This was done to help a bunch of teachers get ideas of how they might like to modify their primary library.

Gmail is indispensable for the collection of listservs I belong to -- where I tag posts as I read them, accumulating my own annotated database, so to speak.

Bloglines is where my RSS feeds come in to.

Then, last but not least, I still rely on

IKeepBookmarks

as my "home page" when I fire up Mozilla, displaying my most commonly accessed links -- laid out as main plus subfolders.  Of course, the most commonly accessed links are all the other attention structures just listed.
