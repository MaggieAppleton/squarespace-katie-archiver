The importance of generating good, meaty, essential questions, especially for student projects, is something everyone agrees on. However, those of us in a school with an explicit inquiry-based learning framework in place often feel ahead of the game.

For example, at

Doug Johnson

's

EARCOS 2007

pre-conference workshop for teacher/librarians on

Designing Projects Students (and Teachers) Love

, those of us at

PYP

schools felt his 4-level Research Question Rubric -- where Level 1 asks for

simple recall

, Level 2 asks

a specific question

, Level 3 asks for

personal response

, and Level 4 includes

a call for action

-- simply reflected different stages in the inquiry process.

Using

Kath Murdoch's inquiry cycle model

, a Level 1 question is equivalent to

Tuning In

, a Level 2 question might be

Finding Out

or

Sorting Out

, a Level 3 question reflects

Going Further

or

Making Conclusions

, and a Level 4 question falls under

Taking Action

followed by

Sharing

/

Reflection

. So, while he was trying to get us to generate a Level 4 question to assign to students, we all felt the rubric was just a spiral students would move along themselves in any one project or unit of inquiry.

When the question of appropriate assessment (or assignments) came up at the

IBAP conference

,

Prof. Stephen Heppell

had a few great substitutions he threw out to us (likes scraps to hungry animals) -- especially after the

IB Diploma

students participating in the forum complained about two years of effort being assessed in a 2-hour

handwritten

exam worth 80% of their grade.

~ instead of an 80% exam, why not require a 3-nation collaborative task for students?

~ instead of assigning a 1,500 word essay, why not require either a) scripting and posting a 3-minute podcast, or b) managing an online discussion for a week, or c) annotating 10 website links?

~ instead of bemoaning the availability of "free online essays" for students to pinch, why not assign the task of choosing 4 "free online essays" and critiquing them, and then improving on one of them?

I mentioned this to my daughter and a friend, both of whom are about to take the

IGCSE

/

GCSE

exams, and they leapt onto the last idea, saying how useful it would be for them to critique other people's essays -- to internalize the examiners' rubric and understand more fully what it is they are being asked to perform.
