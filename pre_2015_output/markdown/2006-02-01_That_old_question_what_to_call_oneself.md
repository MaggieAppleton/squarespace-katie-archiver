Reading about

the "blended librarian" movement

(started by Steven Bell and John Shank) makes me wonder whether a blended librarian is just another name for a teacher/librarian  -- only at the university level.

Here's their mission statement (it features that teacher/librarian mantra -- collaboration):

The Blended Librarians Online Learning Community is librarians, faculty, instructional designers and technologists, and other academic support personnel working collaboratively to integrate the library into the teaching and learning process. It is designed to encourage and enable academic librarians to evolve into a new role that blends existing library and information skills with those of instructional design and technology. To that end, the Community leverages innovation, collaboration, and communication to bring together its members in a virtual environment for professional development and learning opportunities.
