preâ€¢search

n.

The initial, guided investigation of topics, themes and main ideas for schoolwork before delving into the deeper research process.

An activity sincerely appreciated by overworked librarians, offered by Answers.com.

This is clever marketing aimed at librarians on the part of

.

"Presearch" isn't a term explicitly used in well-known research models like

the Big6

or

the NSW (Australia) Information Process

,  but it was definitely a focus of attention in several workshops I attended at the EARCOS and IBAP conferences (see

previous posting

).

Most people agreed that "

Define

" as step one implied a big first step that students find daunting.  They need to be encouraged to take their time.

That's why I like the first step in

Kath Murdoch's inquiry model

-- which is called

Tuning In

(followed by Finding Out, Sorting Out, Going Further, Making Conclusions, Taking Action, and Sharing/Reflection).

Tuning In

is also more in line with the first step of the

revised Bloom's taxonomy

(in which Remember replaced Knowledge as the lowest level; another revision was to switch the positions of Synthesis and Evaluate -- putting Create as the highest order):

1.

Remember

2.

Understand

3.

Apply

4.

Analyze

5.

Evaluate

6.

Create

Remembering is a good way of tuning in -- asking what we already know before we start finding out.  It also reflects the level of just being able to spew out undigested facts.

At the IBAP conference,

Cathy Hill and Yvonne Hammer

introduced me to a new model:

Parnes' Creative Problem Solving

model (which they say is frequently used with gifted and talented students, based on the belief that creativity is a set of behaviors that can be learned).

Clarification

stage:

1.

Mess Finding

(e.g., brainstorming)

2.

Data Finding

(collecting the facts, acting as a camera while looking at the "mess" -- a major evaluative tool)

3.

Problem Finding

(prioritizing options, speculating, focusing, and finally forming a statement or question)

*

Transformation

stage:

4.

Idea Finding

(generating ideas and feeling responses, elaborating, more brainstorming)

*

Implementation

stage:

5.

Solution Finding

(evaluating, re-examining the focus, identifying leads, and analysing views of the problem)

6.

Acceptance Finding

(considering the audience, target the priorities, developing a plan of action, editing, presenting work)

I particularly like the word "mess" as the place to begin -- because that's exactly how I feel when I start off on a new project.  I create a big mess of information and have to sort through it.

Perhaps

"digging in"

is a better phrase for that first step -- as it combines the idea of "

tuning in

" and making a "

mess

".
