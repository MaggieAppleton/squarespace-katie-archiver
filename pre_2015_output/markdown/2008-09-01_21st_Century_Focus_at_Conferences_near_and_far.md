Hands On: Literacy in the 21st Century Classroom and Library

is the one-day conference our

Singapore international school librarian network

is putting on

Saturday, 15 November 2008

at the Australian International School Singapore.   It's modeled on the

Teach IT

conference of the IT educator network, which was offered in November 2005 and 2007.  Note that anyone is welcome to attend, whether you work in Singapore or not.

We're still at the

Call for Workshops

stage (until Sep. 30th).   Topics can cover

all forms of literacy,

whether

visual

,

digital

,

information

,

critical

,

mathematical

,

historical

,

scientific

,

political, media

,

cultural

,

spatial

,

social

,

ethical

, or the traditional

textual

. We especially welcome workshops with a "hands-on" component or practical application of theory.

Wish I could have attended the

Learning 2.0 conference

up in Shanghai this week, but with a new campus we were in lock-down mode for the month of September.  Others, from our old campus, did get to go, e.g., Ben Morgan gave a workshop on

Creating a 21st Century Learning Environment in Your School: From Strategic Vision to Reality

(his slide presentation and handouts are available for download from that link page).  As IT director, his take is the big picture and I appreciate we've come a long way, however, I still chafe at StudyWiz and its inability to let people roam around and see what other teachers are doing.  It's structure is basically silos, or, what happens in your classroom stays in your classroom.  It may suit secondary, but not primary.  Though we at the East Campus are trying to find ways to be as open as possible, using the StudyWiz junior interface.

Roaming around the Learning 2.0 conference ning,  "21st Century" jumps out as a major buzzword.  Note these workshop sessions:
