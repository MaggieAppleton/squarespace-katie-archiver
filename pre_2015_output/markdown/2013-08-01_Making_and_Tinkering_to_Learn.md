If you want to have a good read about the history and future of the "making" movement in education and tinkering as "a mindset for learning," I highly recommend the book

"Invent to Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom -- by Sylvia Libow Martinez and Gary Stager

.

Go to their website for an overview of the chapters, with links to extended resources for each.

The best thing it did was to send me back to read/re-read

Seymour Papert

, the grandfather of the movement.  (I didn't realize the roots of his projects were in Maine.)

I also refreshed my acquaintance with the writings of

Mitchel Resnick

(head of the MIT Lifelong Kindergarten group) re the cycle of imagine, create, play, share, reflect, imagine.  And a biography of Nikola Tesla is on my "to read" list.

A few notes/quotes from the book:

Stager's hypothesis:  "A good prompt is worth a thousand words." -- where 'good' means it has (a) brevity (e.g., can fit on a post-it note), (b) ambiguity (let the learner be free to satisfy the prompt in their own voice), and (c) has immunity to assessment. (60-61)

Learners can exceed expectations with the following four variables in place:

-- a good prompt, motivating challenge, or thoughtful question

-- appropriate materials

-- sufficient time

-- a supportive culture, including a range of expertise (60)

"Great teachers know that their highest calling is to make memories." (67)

"Constructivism is a theory of learning that doesn't mandate a specified method of teaching.... Constructionism is a theory of teaching.  We believe that constructionism is the best way to implement constructivist learning." (71)

Advice: skip the pre-load, don't overteach planning, encourage continuous improvement, allow reflection. (77)

Assessment interrupts the learning process.  Even asking a kid what they're doing is disruptive. (81)

"Writing, filmmaking, and presenting information are the low-hanging fruit of creative expression in the digital age." (84)

"The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge." -- Seymour Papert (157)

Educators need to be reminded that it is possible to learn without being taught. (202)

Reading the book, I remembered my father's workshop down cellar in the house in Maine where I grew up.  We loved to make things with him.  My biggest project was a bookcase that would double as my bed's headboard.  Mainly we marveled at how he could fix things.  He was definitely a tinkerer.

A few years ago it was time to clear the workshop out.  After all, he'd been dead for some twenty years and no one was using it.  But I took some last photos.
