My notes

from the EARCOS (East Asia Regional Council on Overseas Schools) Teachers' Conference in Manila held two weeks ago are now typed up.  Useful as my own memory enhancement technique -- even if no one else ever reads them!

In terms of school librarianship, the time spent with

Ross Todd

of

CISSL

was invaluable.  He's an iconoclastic pixie in adult form -- terribly knowledgeable and 'naughty' -- effectively campaigning for

guided inquiry

and

evidence-based practice

(proving that you're actually adding to the learning process) rather than the drum-beating and public worship of

information literacy

as the focus of the

Information-Learning Specialist

(aka the school librarian):

--- Step out of libraryland! -- Step out of information literacy land! -- It's not about finding stuff anymore! -- Get over it! -- That annual library tour and all that Dewey babble are just a waste of time!  -- Get off that information literacy pedestal! -- Get over it!

Instead

-- What we want is the discovery of knowledge, not the discovery of resources -- knowledge construction, not product construction

-- I see appalling things going on - with little learning as the outcome

-- Guided inquiry is back-door Information Literacy

-- Guided inquiry is a staged process and mediation is where you come in

-- Intervention is about identifying what the kids need and figuring out how to get them to the next stage

-- Kids are being abandoned (usually in the name of 'independent research') at the most critical stage - when they're ready to interrogate all the 'stuff' they've found

-- Knowledge in - or via - conflict is what's really important

-- We need to confront kids with alternative perspectives and conflicting ideas -- and help them grapple with evidence, arguments and judgements

-- It's about getting the kids to develop personal positions

-- Think outside the information literacy box -- Think about what intellectual scaffolds you can provide

-- Don't make information literacy standards or library skills separate from curriculum standards!  Information literacy is a secondary, derived standard -- You need to look at the curriculum standards THROUGH the information literacy lens.

-- Documenting your sources (i.e., teaching bibliographic citation skills) is part of the knowledge experience -- it shouldn't be a library lesson!

-- Highlight your rubrics on your school library webpage - not your library rules!

-- Avoid PFS ("petty fine syndrome") and LHC ("loans harrassment complex")!

-- Keep asking yourself: "Did they learn anything?"

But it was Ross's excitement over doing research that made the biggest impression.  I started thinking about mini research projects of my own in my new job come August, e.g., establishing baseline surveys of kids' knowledge and levels of multi-literacies in order to track just what added value a teacher librarian can provide (especially as the school doesn't have one at the moment) and the positive difference created by collaboration...
