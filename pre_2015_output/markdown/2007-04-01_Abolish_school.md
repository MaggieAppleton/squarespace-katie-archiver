I just love to read calls to abolish schools.  If only we had to courage to do it.

Robert Epstein, author of the recently published

The Case Against Adolescence: Rediscovering the Adult in Every Teen

, openly argues for it in his article "

Let's Abolish High School

" in Education Week.  Just as

Alvin Toffler explained

why we need to shut down the public education system in the Feb. 2007 issue of Edutopia.

It's what

Prof. Stephen Heppell

was suggesting at the

IBAP conference

:  instead of schools, what if we could measure what people know and offer a free, global model of recognition of accomplishment? A kind of YouTube for learning outcomes, as he said.

During his talk, Heppell showed us several examples of work by "researchers" (as students are called, to distance them from traditional school language) participating his

notschool.net

project.  These kids, excluded from traditional schools for some reason, are given a brand-new Macintosh computer, a broadband internet connection, and mentors -- and the learning begins.  The program has exceeded all expectations. (See

this report

on the Apple Learning website.)

Heppell was also instrumental in the establishment of

Ultraversity

-- a degree course now offered at a UK university, where people can work full-time and study full-time -- by learning about the work they're already doing. (See this

2003 Guardian (UK) article

on Ultraversity.)
