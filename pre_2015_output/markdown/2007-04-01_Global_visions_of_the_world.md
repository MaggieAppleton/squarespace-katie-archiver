How can we convey global visions of the world?

A fantastic visual tool I've started using with my primary students is

worldmapper: the world as you've never seen it before

- a joint project of the Univ of Sheffield (UK) and the Univ of Michigan (US).

Statistics about the world are presented on a world map where each country or area swells or shrinks in proportion to the data being represented.  A picture is worth a thousand words -- start with the basic

land area

, then move on to

population

, then look at the estimates of the distribution of

the world's wealth in the year 1

(yes, 2000 years ago) and in

the year 2015

.  There are 366 maps so far, covering pollution, disease, resources, violence, education, etc.  It's a site to watch.

Then there's the

Breathing Earth

website which shows you births, deaths, and carbon dioxide emissions in real time around the globe.

On a more artistic note, see

Jonathan Harris

's

Universe

project which "reveals our modern mythology" using input from the news portal

Daylife

.
