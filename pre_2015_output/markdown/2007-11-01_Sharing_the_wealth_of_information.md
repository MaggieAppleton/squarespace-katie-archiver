Our

TeachIT

workshop today on

Social Software in School and Life

is not so much HOW to use these Web 2.0 tools (blogs, wikis, online catalogs, photo sharing, etc.), but

what you might do with them

.  The power of the social comes from seeing how others make use of tools.  So we're hoping

our chart

will get filled in with examples from our participants.

What is the best way to share information?

SHARING LISTS OF BOOKS: Example 1:

PYP Resources

PYP teacher-librarians are always being asked to provide a book that exemplifies the

IB Learner Profile

.  And paper lists of relevant books are always being passed around.  My solution to this was

LibraryThing

, an online cataloguing program.

My catalog --

UWC_PYP

(see

description

)

started out as a means of consolidating lists of books that relate to

the IB Learner Profile

(examples of how we can be

Inquirers

,

Thinkers

,

Communicators

,

Risk-takers

,

Knowledgeable

,

Principled

,

Caring

,

Open-minded

,

Balanced

, and

Reflective

), however, it's now all-purpose.

For example, my children's literature discussion group recently focused on books featuring contemporary cultures.  So I took the various recommendations and information collected them under the tag "contemporary cultures" in my UWC_PYP catalog.  Voila! --

an instant "contemporary cultures" reading list

.

As the school librarian, I also have been frustrated with finding out (and keeping track) of the sets of novels available (but not easily accessible) in all the grade levels' reading cupboards.  I run an after-school book club so always need new sets of novels.  Once I got the teachers to give me their paper lists, I quickly entered them in a LibraryThing catalog:

UWC_novelsets

.

Note how the tags

tell me where the books are and how many are available (where '?' indicates I'm still not sure!).
